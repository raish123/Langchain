LangChain is an open-source framework that helps developers build applications powered by large language models. 
It provides utilities to manage prompts, connect with external APIs, perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), 
and handle conversation memory.

Text splitting is one of the most important utilities in LangChain. Since LLMs have token limits, 
large documents cannot be processed at once. To solve this, LangChain uses different types of splitters 
like RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, SentenceTransformers, and TokenTextSplitter.

For example, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter splits text into smaller chunks while trying to maintain sentence integrity. 
This is very useful for tasks like summarization, question answering, or semantic search, 
where context plays an important role.

With proper chunking, developers can ensure that their applications are efficient, scalable, 
and provide high-quality outputs. Visualization of how text is split can help in tuning chunk size and overlap 
to achieve the best performance.
