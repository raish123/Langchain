      "[Document(metadata={'source': 'transcript_demis.txt'}, page_content=\"the following is a conversation with\\ndemus hasabis\\nceo and co-founder of deepmind\\na company that has published and builds\\nsome of the most incredible artificial\\nintelligence systems in the history of\\ncomputing including alfred zero that\\nlearned\\nall by itself to play the game of gold\\nbetter than any human in the world and\\nalpha fold two that solved protein\\nfolding\\nboth tasks considered nearly impossible\\nfor a very long time\\ndemus is widely considered to be one of\\nthe most brilliant and impactful humans\\nin the history of artificial\\nintelligence and science and engineering\\nin general\\nthis was truly an honor and a pleasure\\nfor me to finally sit down with him for\\nthis conversation and i'm sure we will\\ntalk many times again in the future\\nthis is the lex friedman podcast to\\nsupport it please check out our sponsors\\nin the description and now dear friends\\nhere's demis\\nhassabis\\nlet's start with a bit of a personal\\nquestion\\nam i an ai program you wrote to\\ninterview people until i get good enough\\nto interview you\\nwell i'll be impressed if if you were\\ni'd be impressed by myself if you were i\\ndon't think we're quite up to that yet\\nbut uh maybe you're from the future lex\\nif you did would you tell me is that is\\nthat a good thing to tell a language\\nmodel that's tasked with interviewing\\nthat it is in fact um ai maybe we're in\\na kind of meta turing test uh probably\\nprobably it would be a good idea not to\\ntell you so it doesn't change your\\nbehavior right this is a kind of\\nheisenberg uncertainty principle\\nsituation if i told you you behave\\ndifferently yeah maybe that's what's\\nhappening with us of course this is a\\nbenchmark from the future where they\\nreplay 2022 as a year before ais were\\ngood enough yet and now we want to see\\nis it going to pass exactly\\nif i was such a\\nprogram would you be able to tell do you\\nthink so to the touring test question\\nyou've talked about\\nthe benchmark for solving intelligence\\nwhat would be the impressive thing\\nyou've talked about winning a nobel\\nprize in a system winning a nobel prize\\nbut i still return to the touring test\\nas a compelling test the spirit of the\\ntouring test is a compelling test\\nyeah the turing test of course it's been\\nunbelievably influential and turing's\\none of my all-time heroes but i think if\\nyou look back at the 1950 papers\\noriginal paper and read the original\\nyou'll see i don't think he meant it to\\nbe a rigorous formal test i think it was\\nmore like a thought experiment almost a\\nbit of philosophy he was writing if you\\nlook at the style of the paper and you\\ncan see he didn't specify it very\\nrigorously so for example he didn't\\nspecify the knowledge that the expert or\\njudge would have um not you know how\\nmuch time would they have to investigate\\nthis so these important parameters if\\nyou were gonna make it uh a true sort of\\nformal test\\num and you know some by some measures\\npeople claimed the turing test passed\\nseveral you know a decade ago i remember\\nsomeone claiming that with a with a kind\\nof very bog standard normal uh\\nlogic model um because they pretended it\\nwas a it was a kid so the the judges\\nthought that the machine you know was\\nwas a was a child so um that would be\\nvery different from an expert ai person\\nuh interrogating a machine and knowing\\nhow it was built and so on so i think um\\nyou know we should probably move away\\nfrom that as a formal test and move more\\ntowards a general test where we test the\\nai capabilities on a range of tasks and\\nsee if it reaches human level or above\\nperformance on maybe thousands perhaps\\neven millions of tasks eventually and\\ncover the entire sort of cognitive space\\nso i think\\nfor its time it was an amazing thought\\nexperiment and also 1950s obviously it\\nwas barely the dawn of the computer age\\nso of course he only thought about text\\nand now um we have a lot more different\\ninputs\\nso yeah maybe the better thing to test\\nis the generalizability so across\\nmultiple tasks but i think it's also\\npossible as as systems like god show\\nthat\\neventually that might map right back to\\nlanguage so you might be able to\\ndemonstrate your ability to generalize\\nacross tasks\\nby then communicating your ability to\\ngeneralize across tasks which is kind of\\nwhat we do through conversation anyway\\nwhen we jump around\\nultimately what's in there in that\\nconversation is not just you moving\\naround knowledge\\nit's you moving around like these\\nentirely different modalities of\\nunderstanding that ultimately map to\\nyour ability to\\nto uh operate successfully in all these\\ndomains which you can think of as tasks\\nyeah i think certainly we as humans use\\nlanguage as our main generalization\\ncommunication tool so i think we end up\\nthinking in language and expressing our\\nsolutions in language um so it's going\\nto be very powerful\\nuh uh mode in which to uh explain you\\nknow the system to explain what it's\\ndoing um but i don't think it's the only\\nuh uh modality that matters so i think\\nthere's gonna be a lot of you know\\nthere's there's a lot of different ways\\nto express uh capabilities uh other than\\njust language\\nyeah visual\\nrobotics body language\\num\\nyeah action is the interactive aspect of\\nall that that's all part of it but\\nwhat's interesting with gato is that\\nit's a it's it's it's sort of pushing\\nprediction to the maximum in terms of\\nlike you know mapping arbitrary\\nsequences to other sequences and sort of\\njust predicting what's going to happen\\nnext so prediction seems to be\\nfundamental to intelligence\\nand what you're predicting\\ndoesn't so much matter yeah it seems\\nlike you can generalize that quite well\\nso obviously language models predict the\\nnext word um gato predicts potentially\\nany uh action or any token uh and it's\\njust the beginning really it's our most\\ngeneral agent one could call it so far\\nbut um you know that itself can be\\nscaled up massively more than we've done\\nso far obviously we're in the in the\\nmiddle of doing that but the big part of\\nsolving agi is creating benchmarks that\\nhelp us get closer and closer sort of\\ncreating benchmarks that test the\\njournalizability and it's just still\\ninteresting that this fella alan turing\\nwas one of the first and probably still\\none of the only people that was trying\\nmaybe philosophically but was trying to\\nformulate a benchmark that could be\\nfollowed it is\\neven though it's it's fuzzy it's still\\nsufficiently rigorous to where you can\\nrun that test and i still think\\nsomething like the touring test will at\\nthe end of the day\\nbe the thing that truly\\nimpresses other humans\\nso that you can have a close friend\\nwho's an ai system\\nfor that friend to be a good friend\\nthey're going to have to be able to\\nuh play starcraft\\nand they're going to have to do all of\\nthese tasks um get you a beer so the\\nrobotics tasks\\nuh play games with you use language\\nhumor all those kinds of things but that\\nultimately can boil down to language it\\nfeels like not in terms of the ai\\ncommunity but in terms of the actual\\nimpact of general intelligence on the\\nworld it feels like language will be the\\nplace where it truly shines i think so\\nbecause it's such an important kind of\\ninput output for us i think you're right\\ni think the turing test that what the\\nthe kind of the the philosophy behind it\\nwhich is the idea of can can a machine\\nmimic the behaviors of a human and men\\nand i would say wider than just language\\nand text\\nthen you know in terms of actions and\\neverything else creativity all these\\nthings then um if it can sort of match\\nor exceed human cognitive capabilities\\nthen i think we have a you know true\\nintelligence so i thought from that\\nperspective you're right i think he did\\nformulate the right uh kind of uh setup\\ni just i think there'll be a kind of\\nhumor\\nin the ai systems of the future looking\\nback to this conversation\\nand thinking about the touring test\\nand uh also thinking about\\nby that time they would know which year\\nthey were finally able to sort of cross\\nthe threshold of human level\\nintelligence and think\\nhow funny it is that we humans were\\nstill\\nconfused about this whole problem\\nthat has been long ago been solved\\nwell hello to the ai agents of the\\nfuture anyway so going back to your\\nto your journey when did you fall in\\nlove with programming first\\nwell it's pretty uh pretty young age\\nactually so um\\nyou know i started off uh actually games\\nwas my first love so starting to play\\nchess when i was around four years old\\nand then um it was actually with\\nwinnings from a chess competition that i\\nmanaged to buy my first chess computer\\nwhen i was about eight years old it was\\na zx spectrum which was hugely popular\\nin the uk at the time\\nand uh it's amazing machine because i\\nthink it trained a whole generation of\\nprogrammers in the uk because it was so\\naccessible you know you literally\\nswitched it on and there was the basic\\nprompt and you could just get going and\\num my parents didn't really know\\nanything about computers so but because\\nit was my money from a chess competition\\ni could i could say i i wanted to buy it\\nuh and then you know i just went to\\nbookstores got books on programming and\\num started typing in you know the\\nprogramming code and and then of course\\num once you start doing that you start\\nadjusting it and then making your own\\ngames and that's when i fell in love\\nwith computers and realized that they\\nwere a very magical device um in a way i\\nkind of i would have been able to\\nexplain this at the time but i felt that\\nthey were sort of almost a magical\\nextension of your mind i always had this\\nfeeling and i've always loved this about\\ncomputers that you can set them off\\ndoing something some task for you you\\ncan go to sleep come back the next day\\nand it's solved\\num you know that feels magical to me so\\ni mean all machines do that to some\\nextent they all enhance our natural\\ncapabilities obviously cars make us\\nallow us to move faster than we can run\\nbut this was a machine to extend the\\nmind\\nand and then of course ai is the\\nultimate expression of what a machine\\nmay be able to do or learn so\\nvery naturally for me that thought\\nextended into into ai quite quickly\\nremember the the programming language\\nthat was first\\nstarted\\nspecial to the machine no it was just\\nthe base it was just i think it was just\\nbasic uh on the zx spectrum i don't know\\nwhat specific form it was and then later\\non i got a commodore amiga which uh\\nwas a fantastic machine no you're just\\nshowing off so yeah well lots of my\\nfriends had atari st's and i i managed\\nto get amigas it was a bit more powerful\\nand uh and that was incredible and used\\nto do um programming in assembler and\\nand uh also amos basic this this\\nspecific form of basic it was incredible\\nactually as well all my coding skills\\nand when did you fall in love with ai so\\nwhen did you first\\nstart to gain an understanding that you\\ncan not just write programs that\\ndo some mathematical operations for you\\nwhile you sleep but something that's\\na keen to\\nbringing an entity to life\\nsort of\\na thing that can figure out something\\nmore complicated than uh\\nthan a simple mathematical operation\\nyeah so there was a few stages for me\\nall while i was very young so first of\\nall as i was trying to improve at\\nplaying chess i was captaining various\\nengland junior chess teams and at the\\ntime when i was about you know maybe 10\\n11 years old i was gonna become a\\nprofessional chess player that was my\\nfirst\\nthought um that dream was there sure she\\ntried to get to the highest level yeah\\nso i was um you know i got to when i was\\nabout 12 years old i got to master stand\\nand i was second highest rated player in\\nthe world to judith polgar who obviously\\nended up being an amazing chess player\\nand uh world women's champion and when i\\nwas trying to improve at chess where you\\nknow what you do is you obviously first\\nof all you're trying to improve your own\\nthinking processes so that leads you to\\nthinking about thinking how is your\\nbrain coming up with these ideas why is\\nit making mistakes how can you how can\\nyou improve that thought process but the\\nsecond thing is that you it was just the\\nbeginning this was like in the in the\\nearly 80s mid 80s of chess computers if\\nyou remember they were physical boards\\nlike the one we have in front of us and\\nyou pressed down the you know the\\nsquares and i think kasparov had a\\nbranded version of it that i i i got and\\num you were you know used to they're not\\nas strong as they are today but they\\nwere they were pretty strong and you\\nused to practice against them um to try\\nand improve your openings and other\\nthings and so i remember i think i\\nprobably got my first one i was around\\n11 or 12. and i remember thinking um\\nthis is amazing you know how how has\\nsomeone programmed uh uh this this chess\\nboard to play chess uh and uh it was\\nvery formative book i bought which was\\ncalled the chess computer handbook by\\ndavid levy which came out in 1984 or\\nsomething so i must have got it when i\\nwas about 11 12 and it explained fully\\nhow these chess programs were made i\\nremember my first ai program being uh\\nprogramming my amiga it couldn't it\\nwasn't powerful enough to play chess i\\ncouldn't write a whole chess program but\\ni wrote a program for it to play othello\\nreversey it's sometimes called i think\\nin the u.s and so a slightly simpler\\ngame than chess but i used all of the\\nprinciples that chess programs had alpha\\nbeta search all of that and that was my\\nfirst ai program i remember that very\\nwell was around 12 years old so that\\nthat that brought me into ai and then\\nthe second part was later on uh when i\\nwas around 1617 and i was writing games\\nprofessionally designing games uh\\nwriting a game called theme park which\\num had ai as a core gameplay component\\nas part of the simulation um and it sold\\nyou know millions of copies around the\\nworld and people loved the way that the\\nai even though it was relatively simple\\nby today's ai standards um was was\\nreacting to the way you as the player\\nplayed it so it was called a sandbox\\ngame so it's one of the first types of\\ngames like that along with simcity and\\nit meant that every game you played was\\nunique\\nis there something you could say just on\\na small tangent\\nabout\\nreally impressive ai from a game design\\nhuman enjoyment perspective\\nreally impressive ai that you've seen in\\ngames and maybe what does it take to\\ncreate ai system and how hard of a\\nproblem is that so a million questions\\njust as a brief tangent\\nwell look i think um\\ngames uh games have been significant in\\nmy life for three reasons so first of\\nall to to i was playing them and\\ntraining myself on games when i was a\\nkid then i went through a phase of\\ndesigning games and writing ai4 games so\\nall the games i i professionally wrote\\nuh had ai as a core component and that\\nwas mostly in the in the 90s and the\\nreason i was doing that in games\\nindustry was at the time the games\\nindustry i think was the cutting edge of\\ntechnology so whether it was graphics\\nwith people like john carmack and quake\\nand those kind of things or ai i think\\nactually all the action was going on in\\ngames and and we've seen we're still\\nreaping the benefits of that even with\\nthings like gpus which you know i find\\nironic was obviously invented for\\ngraphics computer graphics but then\\nturns out to be amazingly useful for ai\\nit just turns out everything's a matrix\\nmultiplication it appears you know in\\nthe whole world\\nso um so i think games at the time had\\nthe most cutting edge ai and a lot of\\nthe the games uh uh we you know i was\\ninvolved in writing so there was a game\\ncalled black and white which was one\\ngame i was involved with in the early\\nstages of which i still think is the\\nmost um\\nimpressive uh example of reinforcement\\nlearning in a computer game so in that\\ngame you know you trained a little pet\\nanimal uh and\\nyeah and it sort of learned from how you\\nwere treating it so if you treated it\\nbadly then it became mean yeah and then\\nit would be mean to to your villagers\\nand your and your population the sort of\\nuh the little tribe that you were\\nrunning uh but if you were kind to it\\nthen it would be kind and people were\\nfascinated by how that was and so was i\\nto be honest with the way it kind of\\ndeveloped and um especially the mapping\\nto good and evil yeah it made you made\\nyou realize made me realize that you can\\nsort of in the way in the choices you\\nmake can define\\nuh the\\nwhere you end up and that means\\nall of us are capable of the good\\nuh evil it all matters in uh the\\ndifferent choices along the trajectory\\nto those places that you make it's\\nfascinating i mean games can do that\\nphilosophically to you and it's rare it\\nseems rare yeah well games are i think a\\nunique medium because um you as the\\nplayer you're not just passively\\nconsuming the the entertainment right\\nyou're actually actively involved as an\\nas a as an agent so i think that's what\\nmakes it in some ways can be more\\nvisceral than other other mediums like\\nyou know films and books so the second\\nso that was you know designing ai and\\ngames and then the third use uh uh i've\\nwe've used of ai is in deep mind from\\nthe beginning which is using games as a\\ntesting ground for proving out ai\\nalgorithms and developing ai algorithms\\nand that was a that was a sort of um a\\ncore component of our vision at the\\nstart of deepmind was that we would use\\ngames very heavily uh as our main\\ntesting ground certainly to begin with\\num because it's super efficient to use\\ngames and also you know it's very easy\\nto have metrics to see how well your\\nsystems are improving and what direction\\nyour ideas are going in and whether\\nyou're making incremental improvements\\nand because those games are often rooted\\nin something that humans did for a long\\ntime beforehand\\nthere's already a strong\\nset of rules like it's already a damn\\ngood benchmark yes it's really good for\\nso many reasons because you've got\\nyou've got you've got clear measures of\\nhow good humans can be at these things\\nand in some cases like go we've been\\nplaying it for thousands of years um and\\nand uh often they have scores or at\\nleast win conditions so it's very easy\\nfor reward learning systems to get a\\nreward it's very easy to specify what\\nthat reward is um and uh also at the end\\nit's easy to you know to test uh\\nexternally you know\\nhow strong is your system by of course\\nplaying against you know the world's\\nstrongest players at those games so it's\\nit's so good for so many reasons and\\nit's also very efficient to run\\npotentially millions of simulations in\\nparallel on the cloud so um i think\\nthere's a huge reason why we were so\\nsuccessful back in you know starting out\\n2010 how come we were able to progress\\nso quickly because we'd utilize games\\nand um you know at the beginning of deep\\nmind we also hired some amazing game\\nengineers uh who i knew from my previous\\nuh lives in the games industry and uh\\nand that helped to bootstrap us very\\nquickly and plus it's somehow super\\ncompelling almost at a philosophical\\nlevel of man versus machine\\nover over a chessboard or a go board\\nand especially given that the entire\\nhistory of ai is defined by people\\nsaying it's going to be impossible to\\nmake a machine that\\nbeats a human being in chess\\nand then once that happened\\npeople were certain when i was coming up\\nin ai that go\\nis not a game that could be solved\\nbecause of the combinatorial complexity\\nit's just too it's it's it's you know\\nno matter how much moore's law you have\\ncompute is just never going to be able\\nto crack the game of go yeah and so that\\nthen there's something compelling about\\nfacing sort of taking on the\\nimpossibility of that task from the\\nai\\nresearcher perspective engineer\\nperspective and then as a human being\\njust observing this whole thing\\nyour\\nbeliefs about what you thought was\\nimpossible\\nbeing broken apart\\nit's it's uh humbling\\nto realize we're not as smart as we\\nthought\\nit's humbling to realize that the things\\nwe think are impossible now perhaps will\\nbe done\\nin the future there's something\\nreally powerful about a game ai system\\nbeing a human being in a game that\\ndrives that message\\nuh home for like millions billions of\\npeople especially in the case of go sure\\nwell look i think it's a i mean it has\\nbeen a fascinating journey and and\\nespecially as i i think about it from i\\ncan understand it from both sides both\\nas the ai\\nyou know creators of the ai um but also\\nas a games player originally so you know\\nit was a it was a really interesting it\\nwas i mean it was a fantastic um but\\nalso somewhat bittersweet moment the\\nalphago match for me um uh seeing that\\nand and and being obviously heavily\\nheavily involved in that um but you know\\nas you say chess has been uh the i mean\\nkasparov i think rightly called it the\\ndrosophila of of intelligence right so\\nit's sort of i i love that phrase and\\nand i think he's right because chess has\\nbeen um hand in hand with ai from the\\nbeginning of the the whole field right\\nso i think every ai practitioner\\nstarting with turing and claude shannon\\nand all those uh the sort of forefathers\\nof of of of the field um tried their\\nhand at writing a chess program uh i've\\ngot original audition of claude\\nshannon's first chess program i think it\\nwas 1949 uh the the original sort of uh\\npaper and um they all did that and\\nturing famously wrote a chess program\\nthat but all the computers around there\\nwere obviously too slow to run it so he\\nhad to run he had to be the computer\\nright so he literally i think spent two\\nor three days running his own program by\\nhand with pencil and paper and playing\\nplaying a friend of his uh with his\\nchess program so\\nof course deep blue was a huge moment uh\\nbeating\\noff um but actually when that happened i\\nremember that very very vividly of\\ncourse because it was you know chess and\\ncomputers and ai all the things i loved\\nand i was at college at the time but i\\nremember coming away from that being\\nmore impressed by kasparov's mind than i\\nwas by deep blue because here was\\nkasparov with his human mind not only\\ncould he play chess more or less to the\\nsame level as this brute of a\\ncalculation machine um but of course\\nkasparov can do everything else humans\\ncan do ride a bike talk many languages\\ndo politics all the rest of the amazing\\nthings that kasparov does and so with\\nthe same brain yeah and and yet deep\\nblue uh brilliant as it was at chess it\\nhad been hand coded for chess and um\\nactually had distilled the knowledge of\\nchess grand masters uh into into a cool\\nprogram but it couldn't do anything else\\nlike it couldn't even play a strictly\\nsimpler game like tic-tac-toe so um\\nsomething to me was missing from um\\nintelligence from that system that we\\nwould regard as intelligence and i think\\nit was this idea of generality and and\\nalso learning yeah um so and that's what\\nwe tried to do out with alphago yeah we\\nalphago and alpha zero mu zero and then\\ngot on all the things that uh we'll get\\ninto some parts of there's just a\\nfascinating trajectory here but let's\\njust stick on chess briefly uh on the\\nhuman side of chess you've proposed that\\nfrom a game design perspective the thing\\nthat makes chess\\ncompelling as a game\\nuh is that there's a creative tension\\nbetween a bishop\\nand the knight\\ncan you explain this first of all it's\\nreally interesting to think about what\\nmakes the game compelling\\nmakes it stick across centuries\\nyeah i was sort of thinking about this\\nand actually a lot of even amazing chess\\nplayers don't think about it necessarily\\nfrom a games designer point of view so\\nit's with my game design hat on that i\\nwas thinking about this why is chess so\\ncompelling\\nand i think a critical uh reason is the\\nthe dynamicness of of of the different\\nkind of chess positions you can have\\nwhether they're closed or open and other\\nthings comes from the bishop and the\\nnight so if you think about how\\ndifferent the the the capabilities of\\nthe bishop and knight are in terms of\\nthe way they move and then somehow chess\\nhas evolved to balance those two\\ncapabilities more or less equally so\\nthey're both roughly worth three points\\neach so you think that dynamics was\\nalways there and then the rest of the\\nrules are kind of trying to stabilize\\nthe game well maybe i mean it's sort of\\ni don't know his chicken and egg\\nsituation probably both came together\\nbut the fact that it's got to this\\nbeautiful equilibrium where you can have\\nthe bishop and knight they're so\\ndifferent in power um but so equal in\\nvalue across the set of the universe of\\nall positions right somehow they've been\\nbalanced by humanity over hundreds of\\nyears um i think gives gives the game\\nthe creative tension uh that you can\\nswap the bishop and knights uh for a\\nbishop for a knight and you you they're\\nmore or less worth the same but now you\\naim for a different type of position if\\nyou have the knight you want a closed\\nposition if you have the bishop you want\\nan open position so i think that creates\\na lot of the creative tension in chess\\nso some kind of controlled creative\\ntension\\nfrom an ai perspective\\ndo you think ai systems convention\\ndesign games that are optimally\\ncompelling to humans\\nwell that's an interesting question you\\nknow sometimes i get asked about\\nai and creativity and and this and the\\nway i answered that is relevant to that\\nquestion which is that i think they're\\ndifferent levels of creativity one could\\nsay so i think um if we define\\ncreativity as coming up with something\\noriginal right that's that's useful for\\na purpose then you know i think the kind\\nof lowest level of creativity is like an\\ninterpolation so an averaging of all the\\nexamples you see so maybe a very basic\\nai system could say you could have that\\nso you show it millions of pictures of\\ncats and then you say give me an average\\nlooking cat right generate me an average\\nlooking cat i would call that\\ninterpolation then there's extrapolation\\nwhich something like alphago showed so\\nalphago played you know millions of\\ngames of go against itself\\nand then it came up with brilliant new\\nideas like move 37 in game two bringing\\na motif strategies and go that that no\\nhumans had ever thought of even though\\nwe've played it for thousands of years\\nand professionally for hundreds of years\\nso that that i call that extrapolation\\nbut then that's still there's still a\\nlevel above that which is you know you\\ncould call out the box thinking or true\\ninnovation which is could you invent go\\nright could you invent chess and not\\njust come up with a brilliant chess move\\nor brilliant go move but can you can you\\nactually invent chess or something as\\ngood as chess or go and i think one day\\nuh ai could but what's missing is how\\nwould you even specify that task to a a\\nprogram right now and the way i would do\\nit if i was best telling a human to do\\nit or a games designer a human games\\ndesigner to do it is i would say\\nsomething like go i would say um\\ncome up with a game that only takes five\\nminutes to learn which go does because\\nit's got simple rules but many lifetimes\\nto master right or impossible to master\\nin one lifetime because so deep and so\\ncomplex um and then it's aesthetically\\nbeautiful uh and also uh it can be\\ncompleted in three or four hours of\\ngameplay time which is you know useful\\nfor our us you know in in a human day\\nand so um you might specify these side\\nof high level concepts like that and\\nthen you know with that and maybe a few\\nother things uh one could imagine that\\ngo satisfies uh those those constraints\\num but the problem is is that we we're\\nnot able to specify abstract notions\\nlike that high-level abstract notions\\nlike that yet to our ai systems um and i\\nthink there's still something missing\\nthere in terms of um high-level concepts\\nor abstractions that they truly\\nunderstand and that you know combinable\\nand compositional um so for the moment\\ni think ai is capable of doing\\ninterpolation extrapolation but not true\\ninvention so coming up with rule sets\\nuh and optimizing\\nwith complicated objectives around those\\nrule sets we can't currently do\\nbut you could take a specific rule set\\nand then run a kind of self-play\\nexperiment to see how long\\njust observe how an ai system from\\nscratch learns how long is that journey\\nof learning and maybe\\nif it satisfies some of those other\\nthings you mentioned in terms of\\nquickness to learn and so on and you\\ncould see a long journey to master for\\neven an ai system then you could say\\nthat this is a promising game\\num but it would be nice to do almost\\nlike alpha codes or programming rules so\\ngenerating rules that kind of\\nuh\\nthat automate even that part of the\\ngeneration of rules so i have thought\\nabout systems actually um that i think\\nwould be amazing in in for a games\\ndesigner if you could have a system that\\num takes your game plays it tens of\\nmillions of times maybe overnight and\\nthen self balances the rules better so\\nit tweaks the the rules and the maybe\\nthe equations and the and the and the\\nparameters so that the game uh is more\\nbalanced the units in the game or\\nsome of the rules could be tweaked so\\nit's a bit of like a giving a base set\\nand then allowing a monte carlo tree\\nsearch or something like that to sort of\\nexplore it right and i think that would\\nbe super super a powerful tool actually\\nfor for balancing auto balancing a game\\nwhich usually takes\\nthousands of hours from hundreds of\\ngames human games testers normally to to\\nbalance some one you know game like\\nstarcraft which is you know blizzard are\\namazing at balancing their games but it\\ntakes them years and years and years so\\none could imagine at some point when\\nthis uh this stuff becomes uh efficient\\nenough to you know you might be able to\\ndo that like overnight\\ndo you think a game that is optimal\\ndesigned by an ai system\\nwould look very much like uh planet\\nearth\\nmaybe maybe it's only the sort of game i\\nwould love to make is is and i've tried\\nyou know my in my game's career the\\ngames design career you know my first\\nbig game was designing a theme park an\\namusement park then uh with games like\\nrepublic i tried to you know have games\\nwhere we designed whole cities and and\\nallowed you to play in so and of course\\npeople like will wright have written\\ngames like sim earth uh trying to\\nsimulate the whole of earth pretty\\ntricky but um i see earth i haven't\\nactually played that one so what is it\\ndoes it incorporative evolution or yeah\\nit has evolution and it's sort of um it\\ntries to it sort of treats it as an\\nentire biosphere but from quite a high\\nlevel\\nso\\nnice to be able to sort of zoom in zoom\\nout zoom in exactly so obviously he\\ncouldn't do that was in the night i\\nthink he wrote that in the 90s so it\\ncouldn't you know it wasn't it wasn't\\nable to do that but that that would be\\nuh obviously the ultimate sandbox game\\nof course\\non that topic do you think we're living\\nin a simulation\\nyes well so okay so i'm gonna jump\\naround from the absurdly philosophical\\nto the short term sure very very happy\\nto so i think uh my answer to that\\nquestion is a little bit complex because\\nuh there is simulation theory which\\nobviously nick bostrom i think famously\\nfirst proposed um\\nand uh i don't quite believe it in in\\nthat sense so um in the in the sense\\nthat uh are we in some sort of computer\\ngame or have our descendants somehow\\nrecreated uh uh earth in the you know\\n21st century and and some for some kind\\nof experimental reason i think that um\\nbut i do think that we that that we\\nmight be that the best way to understand\\nphysics and the universe is from a\\ncomputational perspective so\\nunderstanding it as an information\\nuniverse and actually information being\\nthe most fundamental unit of uh reality\\nrather than matter or energy so a\\nphysicist would say you know matter or\\nenergy you know e equals m c squared\\nthese are the things that are are the\\nfundamentals of the universe i'd\\nactually say information um which of\\ncourse itself can be can specify energy\\nor matter right matter is actually just\\nyou know we're we're just out the way\\nour bodies and all the molecules in our\\nbody arrange is information so i think\\ninformation may be the most fundamental\\nway to describe the universe and\\ntherefore you could say we're in some\\nsort of simulation because of that um\\nbut i don't i do i'm not i'm not really\\na subscriber to the idea that um you\\nknow these are sort of throw away\\nbillions of simulations around i think\\nthis is actually very critical and\\npossibly unique this simulation\\nparticular one yes so but and you just\\nmean\\ntreating the universe\\nas a computer\\nthat's\\nprocessing and modifying information\\nis is a good way to solve the problems\\nof physics of chemistry of biology\\nand perhaps of humanity and so on yes i\\nthink understanding physics in terms of\\ninformation theory uh might be the best\\nway to to really uh understand what's\\ngoing on here\\nfrom our understanding of a universal\\nturing machine from our understanding of\\na computer do you think there's\\nsomething outside of the capabilities of\\na computer that is present in our\\nuniverse you have a disagreement with\\nroger penrose\\nthe nature of consciousness he he thinks\\nthat consciousness is more than just a\\ncomputation\\nuh do you think all of it the whole\\nshebang is can be can be a competition\\nyeah i've had many fascinating debates\\nwith uh sir roger penrose and obviously\\nhe's he's famously and i read you know\\nemperors of new mind and and um\\nand his books uh his classical books uh\\nand they they were pretty influential\\nand you know in the 90s and um he\\nbelieves that there's something more you\\nknow something quantum that is needed to\\nexplain consciousness in the brain um i\\nthink about what we're doing actually at\\ndeepmind and what my career is being\\nwe're almost like true rings champion so\\nwe are pushing turing machines or\\nclassical computation to the limits what\\nare the limits of what classical\\ncomputing can do now um and at the same\\ntime i've also studied neuroscience to\\nsee and that's why i did my phd in was\\nto see also to look at you know is there\\nanything quantum in the brain from a\\nneuroscience or biological perspective\\nand um and so far i think most\\nneuroscientists and most mainstream\\nbiologists and neuroscientists would say\\nthere's no evidence of any quantum uh\\nsystems or effects in the brain as far\\nas we can see it's it can be mostly\\nexplained by classical uh classical\\ntheories so\\nand then so there's sort of the the\\nsearch from the biology side and then at\\nthe same time there's the raising of the\\nwater uh at the bar from what classical\\nturing machines can do uh uh and\\nand you know including our new ai\\nsystems and uh as you alluded to earlier\\num you know i think ai especially in the\\nlast decade plus has been a continual\\nstory now of surprising uh events uh and\\nsurprising successes knocking over one\\ntheory after another of what was thought\\nto be impossible you know from go to\\nprotein folding and so on and so i think\\num\\ni would be very hesitant to bet against\\nhow far the uh universal turing machine\\nand classical computation paradigm can\\ngo and and my betting would be\\nthat all of certainly what's going on in\\nour brain uh can probably be mimicked or\\nor approximated on a on a classical\\nmachine um not you know not requiring\\nsomething metaphysical or quantum and\\nwe'll get there with some of the work\\nwith alpha fold\\nwhich i think begins the journey of\\nmodeling this beautiful and complex\\nworld of biology so you think all the\\nmagic of the human mind comes from this\\njust a few pounds of mush\\nof a biological computational mush\\nthat's\\nakin to some of the neural networks\\nnot directly but in spirit that deep\\nmind has been working with well look i\\nthink it's um you say it's a few you\\nknow of course it's this is the i think\\nthe biggest miracle of the universe is\\nthat um it is just a few pounds of mush\\nin our skulls and yet it's also our\\nbrains are the most complex objects in\\nthe in that we know of in the universe\\nso there's something profoundly\\nbeautiful and amazing about our brains\\nand\\ni\\nthink that it's an incredibly uh\\nincredible efficient machine and and uh\\nuh\\nand it's a is you know phenomenal\\nbasically and i think that building ai\\none of the reasons i want to build ai\\nand i've always wanted to is i think by\\nbuilding an intelligent artifact like ai\\nand then comparing it to the human mind\\num that will help us unlock the\\nuniqueness and the true secrets of the\\nmind that we've always wondered about\\nsince the dawn of history like\\nconsciousness dreaming uh creativity uh\\nemotions what are all these things right\\nwe've we've wondered about them since\\nsince the dawn of humanity and i think\\none of the reasons and you know i love\\nphilosophy and philosophy of mind is we\\nfound it difficult is there haven't been\\nthe tools for us to really other than\\nintrospection to from very clever people\\nin in history very clever philosophers\\nto really investigate this\\nscientifically but now suddenly we have\\na plethora of tools firstly we have all\\nthe neuroscience tools fmri machines\\nsingle cell recording all of this stuff\\nbut we also have the ability computers\\nand ai to build uh intelligent systems\\nso i think that um\\nuh\\nyou know i think it is amazing what the\\nhuman mind does and um and and i'm kind\\nof in awe of it really and uh and i\\nthink it's amazing that without human\\nminds we're able to build things like\\ncomputers and and actually even you know\\nthink and investigate about these\\nquestions i think that's also a\\ntestament to the human mind yeah the\\nuniverse built the human mind that now\\nis building computers that help\\nus understand both the universe and our\\nown human mind right that's exactly it i\\nmean i think that's one you know one\\ncould say we we are\\nmaybe we're the mechanism by which the\\nuniverse is going to try and understand\\nitself yeah\\nit's beautiful so let's let's go to the\\nbasic building blocks of biology that i\\nthink\\nis another angle at which you can start\\nto understand the human mind the human\\nbody which is quite fascinating which is\\nfrom the basic building blocks start to\\nsimulate start to model\\nhow from those building blocks you can\\nconstruct bigger and bigger more complex\\nsystems maybe one day the entirety of\\nthe human biology so\\nhere's another problem that thought to\\nbe impossible to solve which is protein\\nfolding and alpha fold or\\nspecific alpha fold 2\\ndid just that it solved protein folding\\ni think it's one of the biggest\\nbreakthroughs\\nuh certainly in the history of\\nstructural biology but uh in general in\\nin science\\num\\nmaybe from a high level\\nwhat is it and how does it work\\nand then we can ask some fascinating\\nsure questions after sure um so maybe\\nlike to explain it uh to people not\\nfamiliar with protein folding is you\\nknow i first of all explain proteins\\nwhich is you know proteins are essential\\nto all life every function in your body\\ndepends on proteins sometimes they're\\ncalled the workhorses of biology and if\\nyou look into them and i've you know\\nobviously as part of alpha fold i've\\nbeen researching proteins and and\\nstructural biology for the last few\\nyears you know they're amazing little\\nbio nano machines proteins they're\\nincredible if you actually watch little\\nvideos of how they work animations of\\nhow they work\\nand um proteins are specified by their\\ngenetic sequence called the amino acid\\nsequence so you can think of those their\\ngenetic makeup and then in the body uh\\nin in nature they when they when they\\nfold up into a 3d structure so you can\\nthink of it as a string of beads and\\nthen they fold up into a ball now the\\nkey thing is you want to know what that\\n3d structure is\\nbecause the structure the 3d structure\\nof a protein\\nis what helps to determine what does it\\ndo the function it does in your body\\nand also if you're interested in drug\\ndrugs or disease you need to understand\\nthat 3d structure because if you want to\\ntarget something with a drug compound or\\nabout to block that something the\\nprotein is doing uh you need to\\nunderstand where it's going to bind on\\nthe surface of the protein so obviously\\nin order to do that you need to\\nunderstand the 3d structure so the\\nstructure is mapped to the function the\\nstructure is mapped to the function and\\nthe structure is obviously somehow\\nspecified by the by the amino acid\\nsequence and that's the in essence the\\nprotein folding problem is can you just\\nfrom the amino acid sequence the\\none-dimensional\\nstring of letters can you\\nimmediately computationally predict the\\n3d structure right and this has been a\\ngrand challenge in biology for over 50\\nyears so i think it was first\\narticulated by christian anfinsen a\\nnobel prize winner in 1972 uh as part of\\nhis nobel prize winning lecture and he\\njust speculated this should be possible\\nto go from the amino acid sequence to\\nthe 3d structure we didn't say how so\\ni you know it's been described to me as\\nequivalent to fermat's last theorem but\\nfor biology right you should as somebody\\nthat uh very well might win the nobel\\nprize in the future but outside of that\\nyou should do more of that kind of thing\\nin the margins just put random things\\nthat will take like 200 years to solve\\nset people off for 200 years it should\\nbe possible exactly and just don't give\\nany interest exactly i think everyone's\\nexactly should be i'll have to remember\\nthat for future so yeah so he set off\\nyou know with this one throwaway remark\\njust like fermat you know he he set off\\nthis whole 50-year uh\\nuh uh field really of computational\\nbiology and and they had you know they\\ngot stuck they hadn't really got very\\nfar with doing this and and um until now\\nuntil alpha fold came along this is done\\nexperimentally right very painstakingly\\nso the rule of thumb is and you have to\\nlike crystallize the protein which is\\nreally difficult some proteins can't be\\ncrystallized like membrane proteins and\\nthen you have to use very expensive\\nelectron microscopes or x-ray\\ncrystallography machines really\\npainstaking work to get the 3d structure\\nand visualize the 3d structure so the\\nrule of thumb in in experimental biology\\nis that it takes one phd student their\\nentire phd to do one protein uh and with\\nalpha fold two we were able to predict\\nthe 3d structure in a matter of seconds\\num and so we were you know over\\nchristmas we did the whole human\\nproteome or every protein in the human\\nbody all 20 000 proteins so the human\\nproteins like the equivalent of the\\nhuman genome but on protein space and uh\\nand sort of revolutionize really what uh\\na structural biologist can do because\\nnow um they don't have to worry about\\nthese painstaking experimentals you know\\nshould they put all of that effort in or\\nnot they can almost just look up the\\nstructure of their proteins like a\\ngoogle search\\nand so there's a data set on which it's\\ntrained and how to map this amino acids\\nbecause first of all it's incredible\\nthat a protein this little chemical\\ncomputer is able to do that computation\\nitself in some kind of distributed way\\nand do it very quickly\\nthat's a weird thing and they evolved\\nthat way because you know in the\\nbeginning\\ni mean that's a great invention just the\\nprotein itself yes i mean and then they\\nthere's i think probably a history of\\nlike uh they evolved\\nto have many of these proteins and those\\nproteins figure out how to be computers\\nthemselves\\nin such a way that you can create\\nstructures that can interact in\\ncomplexes with each other in order to\\nform high level functions i mean it's a\\nweird system that they figured it out\\nwell for sure i mean we you know maybe\\nwe should talk about the origins of life\\ntoo but proteins themselves i think are\\nmagical and incredible uh uh uh as i\\nsaid little little bio-nano machines and\\num\\nand and actually levantal who is another\\nscientist uh uh a contemporary of\\nanfinsen uh he he coined this eleventh\\nhouse what became known as levantal's\\nparadox which is exactly what you're\\nsaying he calculated roughly a protein\\nan average protein which is maybe 2 000\\namino acids\\nbases long is um\\nis is can fold in maybe 10 to the power\\n300 different conformations so there's\\n10 to the power 300 different ways that\\nprotein could fold up and yet somehow in\\nnature physics solves this solves this\\nin a matter of milliseconds so proteins\\nfold up in your body in you know\\nsometimes in fractions of a second so\\nphysics is somehow solving that search\\nproblem and just to be clear in many of\\nthese cases maybe you correct me if i'm\\nwrong there's often a unique way\\nfor that sequence to form itself yes so\\namong that huge number of possibilities\\nyes it figures out a way how to\\nstability\\nuh\\nin some cases there might be a\\nmisfunction so on which leads to a lot\\nof the disorders and stuff like that but\\nyes most of the time it's a unique\\nmapping and that unique mapping is not\\nobvious no exactly that's just what the\\nproblem is exactly so there's a unique\\nmapping usually in a healthy in if it's\\nhealthy and as you say in disease\\nso for example alzheimer's one one one\\nconjecture is that it's because of a\\nmisfolded protein a protein that folds\\nin the wrong way amyloid beta protein so\\num and then because it falls in the\\nwrong way it gets tangled up right in\\nyour in your neurons so\\num it's super important to understand\\nboth healthy functioning and also\\ndisease is to understand uh you know\\nwhat what these things are doing and how\\nthey're structuring of course the next\\nstep is sometimes proteins change shape\\nwhen they interact with something so um\\nthey're not just static necessarily in\\nin biology\\nmaybe you can give some interesting sort\\nof beautiful things to you about these\\nearly days of alpha fold of of solving\\nthis problem because\\nunlike games this is\\nreal physical systems that are less\\namenable to\\nself-play type of mechanisms\\nthe the size of the data set is smaller\\nthat you might otherwise like so you\\nhave to be very clever about certain\\nthings is there something you could\\nspeak to um\\nwhat was very hard to solve and what are\\nsome beautiful aspects about the the\\nsolution yeah i would say alpha fold is\\nthe most complex and also probably most\\nmeaningful system we've built so far so\\nit's been an amazing time actually in\\nthe last you know two three years to see\\nthat come through because um as we\\ntalked about earlier you know games is\\nwhat we started on uh building things\\nlike alphago and alpha zero but really\\nthe ultimate goal was to um not just to\\ncrack games it was just to to to build\\nuse them to bootstrap general learning\\nsystems we could then apply to real\\nworld challenges specifically my passion\\nis scientific challenges like protein\\nfolding and then alpha fold of course is\\nour first big proof point of that and so\\num you know in terms of the data uh and\\nthe amount of innovations that had to go\\ninto it we you know it was like more\\nthan 30 different component algorithms\\nneeded to be put together to crack the\\nprotein folding um i think some of the\\nbig innovations were that um\\nkind of building in some hard coded\\nconstraints around physics and\\nevolutionary biology um to constrain\\nsort of things like the bond angles uh\\nuh in the in the in the protein and\\nthings like that um\\na lot but not to impact the learning\\nsystem so still allowing uh the system\\nto be able to learn the physics uh\\nitself um from the examples that we had\\nand the examples as you say there are\\nonly about 150 000 proteins even after\\n40 years of experimental biology only\\naround 150 000 proteins have been the\\nstructures have been found out about so\\nthat was our training set which is um\\nmuch less than normally we would like to\\nuse\\nbut using various tricks things like\\nself distillation so actually using\\nalpha folds predictions um some of the\\nbest predictions that it thought was\\nhighly confident in we put them back\\ninto the training set right to make the\\ntraining set bigger\\nthat was critical to to alpha fold\\nworking so there was actually a huge\\nnumber of different um uh innovations\\nlike that that were required to to\\nultimately crack the problem after fold\\none what it produced was a distagram so\\na kind of\\na matrix of the pairwise distances\\nbetween all of the molecules in the in\\nthe in the protein and then there had to\\nbe a separate optimization process to uh\\ncreate the 3d structure\\nand what we did for alpha volt2 is make\\nit truly end to end so we went straight\\nfrom the amino acid sequence of of of\\nbases to\\nthe 3d structure directly without going\\nthrough this intermediate step and in\\nmachine learning what we've always found\\nis that the more end to end you can make\\nit the better the system and it's\\nprobably because um we you know the in\\nthe end the system is better at learning\\nwhat the constraints are than than we\\nare as the human designers of specifying\\nit so anytime you can let it flow end to\\nend and actually just generate what it\\nis you're really looking for in this\\ncase the 3d structure you're better off\\nthan having this intermediate step which\\nyou then have to hand craft the next\\nstep for so\\nso it's better to let the gradients and\\nthe learning flow all the way through\\nthe system um from the end point the end\\noutput you want to the inputs so that's\\na good way to start a new problem\\nhandcraft a bunch of stuff add a bunch\\nof manual constraints with a small\\nintent learning piece or a small\\nlearning piece and grow that learning\\npiece until it consumes the whole thing\\nthat's right and so you can also see you\\nknow this is a bit of a method we've\\ndeveloped over doing many sort of\\nsuccessful outfits we call them alpha x\\nprojects right is and the easiest way to\\nsee that is the evolution of alphago to\\nalpha zero so alphago was um a learning\\nsystem but it was specifically trained\\nto only play go right so uh and what we\\nwanted to do with first version of go is\\njust get to world champion performance\\nno matter how we did it right and then\\nand then of course alphago zero we we we\\nremoved the need to use human games as a\\nstarting point right so it could just\\nplay against itself from random starting\\npoint from the beginning so that removed\\nthe the need for human knowledge uh\\nabout go and then finally alpha zero\\nthen generalized it so that any things\\nwe had in there the system including\\nthings like symmetry of the go board uh\\nwere removed so the alpha zero could\\nplay from scratch any two player game\\nand then mu0 which is the final\\nlatest version of that set of things was\\nthen extending it so that you didn't\\neven have to give it the rules of the\\ngame it would learn that for itself so\\nit could also deal with computer games\\nas well as board games so that line of\\nalpha golf goes zero alpha zero mu zero\\nthat's the full trajectory of what you\\ncan take from\\nuh imitation learning\\nto full self\\nsupervised learning yeah exactly and\\nlearning learning uh the entire\\nstructure of the environment you put in\\nfrom scratch right and and and and\\nbootstrapping it uh through self-play uh\\nyourself but the thing is it would have\\nbeen impossible i think or very hard for\\nus to build alpha zero or mu0 first out\\nof the box\\neven psychologically because you have to\\nbelieve in yourself for a very long time\\nyou're constantly dealing with doubt\\nbecause a lot of people say that it's\\nimpossible exactly so it was hard enough\\njust to do go as you were saying\\neveryone thought that was impossible or\\nat least a decade away um from when we\\nwhen we did it back in 2015 24 you know\\n2016 and um\\nand so yes it would have been\\npsychologically probably very difficult\\nas well as the fact that of course we\\nlearnt a lot by building alphago first\\nright so it's i think this is why i call\\nai in engineering science it's one of\\nthe most fascinating science disciplines\\nbut it's also an engineering science in\\nthe sense that unlike natural sciences\\num the phenomenon you're studying it\\ndoesn't exist out in nature you have to\\nbuild it first so you have to build the\\nartifact first and then you can study\\nhow how and pull it apart and how it\\nworks this is tough to uh\\nask you this question because you\\nprobably will say it's everything but\\nlet's let's try let's try to think to\\nthis because you're in a very\\ninteresting position where deepmind is\\nthe place of some of the most uh\\nbrilliant ideas in the history of ai but\\nit's also a place of brilliant\\nengineering\\nso how much of solving intelligence this\\nbig goal for deepmind how much of it is\\nscience how much is engineering so how\\nmuch is the algorithms how much is the\\ndata how much is the\\nhardware compute infrastructure how much\\nis it the software computer\\ninfrastructure yeah um what else is\\nthere how much is the human\\ninfrastructure\\nand like just the humans interact in\\ncertain kinds of ways in all the space\\nof all those ideas how much does maybe\\nlike philosophy how much what's the key\\nif um\\nuh\\nif if you were to sort of look back like\\nif we go forward 200 years look back\\nwhat was the key thing that solved\\nintelligence is that ideas\\ni think it's a combination first of all\\nof course it's a combination of all\\nthose things but the the ratios of them\\nchanged over over time\\nso yeah so um even in the last 12 years\\nso we started deep mine in 2010 which is\\nhard to imagine now because 2010 it's\\nonly 12 short years ago but nobody was\\ntalking about ai uh you know if you\\nremember back to your mit days you know\\nno one was talking about it i did a\\npostdoc at mit back around then and it\\nwas sort of thought of as a well look we\\nknow ai doesn't work we tried this hard\\nin the 90s at places like mit mostly\\nlosing using logic systems and\\nold-fashioned sort of good old-fashioned\\nai we would call it now um people like\\nminsky and and and patrick winston and\\nyou know all these characters right and\\nused to debate a few of them and they\\nused to think i was mad thinking about\\nthat some new advance could be done with\\nlearning systems and um i was actually\\npleased to hear that because at least\\nyou know you're on a unique track at\\nthat point right even if every all of\\nyour you know professors are telling you\\nyou're mad that's true and of course in\\nindustry uh you can we couldn't get you\\nknow as difficult to get two cents\\ntogether uh and which is hard to imagine\\nnow as well given it's the biggest sort\\nof buzzword in in vcs and and\\nfundraising's easy and all these kind of\\nthings today so\\nback in 2010 it was very difficult and\\nwhat we the reason we started then and\\nshane and i used to discuss um uh uh\\nwhat were the sort of founding tenets of\\ndeep mind and it was very various things\\none was um algorithmic advances so deep\\nlearning you know jeff hinton and cohen\\njust had just sort of invented that in\\nacademia but no one in industry knew\\nabout it uh we love reinforcement\\nlearning we thought that could be scaled\\nup but also understanding about the\\nhuman brain had advanced um quite a lot\\nuh in the decade prior with fmri\\nmachines and other things so we could\\nget some good hints about architectures\\nand algorithms and and sort of um\\nrepresentations maybe that the brain\\nuses so as at a systems level not at a\\nimplementation level um and then the\\nother big things were compute and gpus\\nright so we could see a compute was\\ngoing to be really useful and it got to\\na place where it became commoditized\\nmostly through the games industry and\\nand that could be taken advantage of and\\nthen the final thing was also\\nmathematical and theoretical definitions\\nof intelligence so things like ai xi aix\\nwhich uh shane worked on with his\\nsupervisor marcus hutter which is a sort\\nof theoretical uh proof really of\\nuniversal intelligence um which is\\nactually a reinforcement learning system\\num in the limit i mean it assumes\\ninfinite compute and infinite memory in\\nthe way you know like a turing machine\\nproof but i was also waiting to see\\nsomething like that too to you know like\\nturing machines uh and and computation\\ntheory that people like turing and\\nshannon came up with underpins modern\\ncomputer science um uh you know i was\\nwaiting for a theory like that to sort\\nof underpin agi research so when i you\\nknow met shane and saw he was working on\\nsomething like that you know that to me\\nwas a sort of final piece of the jigsaw\\nso\\nin the early days i would say that\\nideas were the most important uh you\\nknow and for us it was deep\\nreinforcement learning scaling up deep\\nlearning um of course we've seen\\ntransformers so huge leaps i would say\\nyou know three or four from for if you\\nthink from 2010 until now uh huge\\nevolutions things like alphago um and um\\nand and maybe there's a few more still\\nneeded but as we get closer to ai agi um\\ni think engineering becomes more and\\nmore important and data because scale\\nand of course the the recent you know\\nresults of gpt3 and all the big language\\nmodels and large models including our\\nones uh has shown that scale is a is and\\nlarge models are clearly going to be\\nunnecessary but perhaps not sufficient\\npart of an agi solution and\\nthroughout that like you said and i'd\\nlike to give you a big thank you you're\\none of the pioneers in this is\\nsticking by ideas like reinforcement\\nlearning that this can actually work\\ngiven actually\\nlimited success in the past\\nand also\\nwhich we still don't know but\\nproudly\\nhaving the best researchers in the world\\nand talking about solving intelligence\\nso talking about whatever you call it\\nagi or something like this\\nthat speaking of mit that's that's just\\nsomething not you wouldn't bring up no\\nuh not not maybe you did in uh like 40\\n50 years ago\\nbut that was\\num\\nai was a place where you do tinkering\\nvery small scale not very ambitious\\nprojects and\\nmaybe the biggest ambitious projects\\nwere in the space of robotics and doing\\nlike the darpa challenge sure but the\\ntask of solving intelligence and\\nbelieving you can\\nthat's really really powerful so\\nin order for engineering to do its work\\nto have great engineers build great\\nsystems you have to have that belief\\nthat threats throughout the whole thing\\nthat you can actually solve some of\\nthese impossible challenges yeah that's\\nright and and back in 2010 you know our\\nmission statement um and still is today\\nyou know it was used to be uh solving\\nstep one solve intelligence step two use\\nit to solve everything else yes so if\\nyou can imagine pitching that to a vc in\\n2010 you know the kind of looks we we\\ngot we managed to you know find a few uh\\nkooky people to back us but it was uh it\\nwas tricky and and i and i got to the\\npoint where we we wouldn't mention it to\\nany of our professors because they would\\njust eye roll and think we you know\\ncommitted career suicide and and uh and\\nand you know so it was there's a lot of\\nthings that we had to do but we always\\nbelieved it and one reason you know by\\nthe way one reason we i believe i've\\nalways believed in reinforcement\\nlearning is that\\nthat if you look at neuroscience that is\\nthe way that the you know primate brain\\nlearns one of the main mechanisms is the\\ndopamine system implement some form of\\ntd learning a very famous result in the\\nlate 90s uh where they saw this in\\nmonkeys and uh and as a you know proper\\ngame prediction error so we you know\\nagain in the limit this is this is what\\ni think you can use neuroscience for is\\nis you know any at mathematics you when\\nyou're when you're doing something as\\nambitious as trying to solve\\nintelligence and you're you're you know\\nit's blue sky research no one knows how\\nto do it you you you need to use any\\nevidence or any source of information\\nyou can to help guide you in the right\\ndirection or give you confidence you're\\ngoing in the right direction so so that\\nthat was one reason we pushed so hard on\\nthat and that's and just going back to\\nyour early question about organization\\nthe other big thing that i think we\\ninnovated with at deepmind to encourage\\ninvention and and uh and innovation was\\nthe multi-disciplinary organization we\\nbuilt and we still have today so\\ndeepmind originally was a confluence of\\nthe of the most cutting-edge knowledge\\nin neuroscience with machine learning\\nengineering and mathematics right and\\nand gaming\\nand then since then we built that out\\neven further so we have philosophers\\nhere and and uh by you know ethicists\\nbut also other types of scientists\\nphysicists and so on um and that's what\\nbrings together i tried to build a sort\\nof um new type of bell labs but in this\\ngolden era right uh\\nand and a new expression of that um to\\ntry and uh foster this incredible sort\\nof innovation machine so talking about\\nthe humans in the machine\\nthe mind itself is a learning machine\\nwith a lots of amazing human minds in it\\ncoming together to try and build these\\nuh learning systems\\nif we return to\\nthe big ambitious dream of alpha fold\\nthat may be the early steps on a very\\nlong journey in um\\nin biology\\ndo you think the same kind of approach\\ncan use to predict the structure and\\nfunction of more complex biological\\nsystems so multi-protein interaction\\nand then\\ni mean you can go out from there just\\nsimulating bigger and bigger systems\\nthat eventually simulate something like\\nthe human brain or the human body just\\nthe big mush the mess of the beautiful\\nresilient mesobiology do do you see that\\nas a long-term vision i do and i think\\num\\nyou know if you think about what are the\\nthings top things i wanted to apply ai\\nai2 once we had powerful enough systems\\nbiology and curing diseases and\\nunderstanding biology uh was right up\\nthere you know top of my list that's one\\nof the reasons i personally pushed that\\nmyself and with alpha fold but i think\\nalpha fold uh amazing as it is is just\\nthe beginning um and and and i hope it's\\nevidence of uh what could be done with\\ncomputational methods so um you know\\nalpha fold solve this this huge problem\\nof the structure of proteins but biology\\nis dynamic so really what i imagine from\\nhere we're working on all these things\\nnow is protein protein interaction uh\\nprotein ligand binding so reacting with\\nmolecules um then you want to get build\\nup to pathways and then eventually a\\nvirtual cell that's my dream uh maybe in\\nthe next 10 years and i've been talking\\nactually to a lot of biologists friends\\nof mine paul nurse who runs the qrik\\ninstitute amazing biologist nobel prize\\nwinning biologist we've been discussing\\nfor 20 years now virtual cells could you\\nbuild a virtual simulation of a cell and\\nif you could that would be incredible\\nfor biology and disease discovery\\nbecause you could do loads of\\nexperiments on the virtual cell and then\\nonly at the last stage validate it in\\nthe wet lab so you could you know in\\nterms of the search space of discovering\\nnew drugs you know it takes 10 years\\nroughly to go from uh uh to to go from\\nuh you know identifying a target to uh\\nhaving a drug candidate um maybe that\\ncould be shortened to you know by an\\norder of magnitude with if you could do\\nmost of that that that work in silico so\\nin order to get to a virtual cell\\nwe have to build up uh uh understanding\\nof different parts of biology and the\\ninteractions and and um so you know\\nevery every few years we talk about this\\nwith i talked about this with paul and\\nthen finally last year after alpha fault\\ni said now is the time we can finally go\\nfor it and and alpha falls the first\\nproof point that this might be possible\\nuh and he's very excited when we have\\nsome collaborations with his with his\\nlab they're just across the road\\nactually from us as you know wonderful\\nbeing here in king's cross with the\\nquick institute across the road and um\\nand i think the next steps you know i\\nthink there's going to be some amazing\\nadvances in biology built on top of\\nthings like alpha fold uh we're already\\nseeing that with the community doing\\nthat after we've open sourced it and\\nreleased it um and uh you know i also i\\noften say that i think\\nuh if you think of mathematics is the\\nperfect description language for physics\\ni think ai might be end up being the\\nperfect description language for biology\\nbecause\\nbiology is so messy it's so emergent so\\ndynamic and complex um i think i find it\\nvery hard to believe we'll ever get to\\nsomething as elegant as newton's laws of\\nmotions to describe a cell right it's\\njust too complicated um so i think ai is\\nthe right tool for this you have to uh\\nyou have to start at the basic building\\nblocks and use ai to run the simulation\\nfor all those building blocks so have a\\nvery strong way to do prediction of what\\ngiven these building blocks what kind of\\nbiology how the\\nthe function\\nand the evolution of that biological\\nsystem\\nit's almost like a cellular automata you\\nhave to run you can't analyze it from a\\nhigh level you have to take the basic\\ningredients figure out the rules yeah\\nand let it run but in this case the\\nrules are very difficult to figure out\\nyes yes learn them that's exactly it so\\nit's the biology is too complicated to\\nfigure out the rules it's it's it's too\\nemergent too dynamic say compared to a\\nphysics system like the motion of a\\nplanet yeah right and and so you have to\\nlearn the rules and that's exactly the\\ntype of systems that we're building so\\nyou you mentioned you've open sourced\\nalpha fold and even the data involved\\nto me personally also\\nreally happy and a big thank you for\\nopen sourcing mijoko\\nuh the physics simulation engine that's\\nthat's often used for robotics research\\nand so on so i think that's a pretty\\ngangster move uh so what what's the\\nwhat's i mean this uh\\nvery few companies or people would do\\nthat kind of thing what's the philosophy\\nbehind that you know it's a case-by-case\\nbasis and in both those cases we felt\\nthat was the maximum benefit to humanity\\nto do that and and the scientific\\ncommunity in one case the robotics uh\\nphysics community with mojoco so\\npurchased it we purchased\\nto obs we purchased it for the express\\nprinciple to open source it so\\num so\\nyou know i hope people appreciate that\\nit's great to hear that you do and then\\nthe second thing was and mostly we did\\nit because the person building it is uh\\nuh would not it was not able to cope\\nwith supporting it anymore because it\\nwas it got too big for him his amazing\\nprofessor uh who who built it in the\\nfirst place so we helped him out with\\nthat and then with alpha folds even\\nbigger i would say and i think in that\\ncase we decided that there were so many\\ndownstream applications of alpha fold um\\nthat we couldn't possibly even imagine\\nwhat they all were so the best way to\\naccelerate uh drug discovery and also\\nfundamental research would be to to um\\ngive all that data away and and and the\\nand the and the system itself um you\\nknow it's been so gratifying to see what\\npeople have done that within just one\\nyear which is a short amount of time in\\nscience and uh it's been used by\\nover 500 000 researchers have used it we\\nthink that's almost every biologist in\\nthe world i think there's roughly 500\\n000 biologists in the world professional\\nbiologists have used it to to look at\\ntheir proteins of interest\\nwe've seen amazing fundamental research\\ndone so a couple of weeks ago front\\ncover there was a whole special issue of\\nscience including the front cover which\\nhad the nuclear pore complex on it which\\nis one of the biggest proteins in the\\nbody the nuclear poor complex is a\\nprotein that governs all the nutrients\\ngoing in and out of your cell nucleus so\\nthey're like little hole gateways that\\nopen and close to let things go in and\\nout of your cell nucleus so they're\\nreally important but they're huge\\nbecause they're massive doughnut rings\\nshaped things and they've been looking\\nto try and figure out that structure for\\ndecades and they have lots of you know\\nexperimental data but it's too low\\nresolution there's bits missing and they\\nwere able to like a giant lego jigsaw\\npuzzle use alpha fold predictions plus\\nexperimental data and combined those two\\nindependent sources of information uh\\nactually four different groups around\\nthe world were able to put it together\\nthe sec more or less simultaneously\\nusing alpha fault predictions so that's\\nbeen amazing to see and pretty much\\nevery pharma company every drug company\\nexecutive i've spoken to has said that\\ntheir teams are using alpha fold to\\naccelerate whatever drugs uh uh they're\\ntrying to discover so i think the\\nknock-on effect has been enormous in\\nterms of uh the impact that uh\\nalpha-fold has made and it's probably\\nbringing in it's creating biologists\\nit's bringing more people into the field\\num\\nboth on the excitement and both on the\\ntechnical skills involved\\nand um\\nit's almost like uh a gateway drug to\\nbiology yes it is you get more\\ncomputational people involved too\\nhopefully and and i think for us you\\nknow the next stage as i said you know\\nin future we have to have other\\nconsiderations too we're building on top\\nof alpha fold and these other ideas i\\ndiscussed with you about protein protein\\ninteractions and and genomics and other\\nthings and not everything will be open\\nsource some of it will will do\\ncommercially because that will be the\\nbest way to actually get the most\\nresources and impact behind it in other\\nways some other projects will do\\nnon-profit style um and also we have to\\nconsider for future things as well\\nsafety and ethics as well like but you\\nknow synthetic biology there are you\\nknow there is dual use and we have to\\nthink about that as well with alpha fold\\nwe you know we consulted with 30\\ndifferent bioethicists and and other\\npeople expert in this field to make sure\\nit was safe before um we released it so\\nthere'll be other considerations in\\nfuture but for right now you know i\\nthink alpha fold is a kind of a gift\\nfrom us to to to the scientific\\ncommunity so i'm pretty sure\\nthat\\nsomething like alpha fold\\nuh would be part of nobel prizes in the\\nfuture\\nbut us humans of course are horrible\\nwith credit assignment so we'll of\\ncourse give it to the humans\\ndo you think there will be a day\\nwhen ai system\\ncan't be denied\\nthat it earned that nobel prize do you\\nthink we'll see that in 21st century it\\ndepends what type of ais we end up\\nbuilding right whether they're um\\nyou know goal seeking agents who\\nspecifies the goals uh who comes up with\\nthe hypotheses\\nwho you know who determines which\\nproblems to tackle right so i think it's\\nabout an announcement yeah so it's\\nannouncing the results exactly as part\\nof it um so i think right now of course\\nit's it's it's it's amazing human\\ningenuity that's behind these systems\\nand then the system in my opinion is\\njust a tool you know it'd be a bit like\\nsaying with galileo and his telescope\\nyou know the ingenuity the the the\\ncredit should go to the telescope i mean\\nit's clearly galileo building the tool\\nwhich he then uses\\nso i still see that in the same way\\ntoday even though these tools learn for\\nthemselves um they're i think i think of\\nthings like alpha fold and that the\\nthings we're building as the ultimate\\ntools for science and for acquiring new\\nknowledge to help us as scientists\\nacquire new knowledge i think one day\\nthere will come a point where\\nan ai system may solve or come up with\\nsomething like general relativity of its\\nown bat not just by\\naveraging everything on the internet or\\naveraging everything on pubmed\\nalthough that would be interesting to\\nsee what that would come up with um so\\nthat to me is a bit like our earlier\\ndebate about creativity you know\\ninventing go rather than just coming up\\nwith a good go move and um so i think uh\\nsolving i think to to you know if we\\nwanted to give it the credit of like a\\nnobel type of thing then it would need\\nto invent go uh and sort of invent that\\nnew conjecture out of the blue um rather\\nthan being specified by the the human\\nscientists or the human creators so i\\nthink right now that's it's definitely\\njust a tool although it is interesting\\nhow far you get by averaging everything\\non the internet like you said because\\nyou know\\na lot of people do see science as you're\\nalways standing on the shoulders of\\ngiants and\\nthe question is how much are you really\\nreaching\\nup above the shoulders of giants maybe\\nit's just assimilating different kinds\\nof\\nresults of the past\\nwith ultimately this new perspective\\nthat gives you this breakthrough idea\\nbut that idea may not be\\nnovel in the way that we can't be\\nalready discovered on the internet maybe\\nthe nobel prizes\\nof the next 100 years are already all\\nthere on the internet to be discovered\\nthey could be they could be i mean i\\nthink um\\nthis is one of the big mysteries i think\\nis that uh\\nuh i i first of all i believe a lot of\\nthe big new breakthroughs that are going\\nto come in the next few decades and even\\nin the last decade are going to come at\\nthe intersection between different\\nsubject areas where um there'll be some\\nnew connection that's found between what\\nseemingly with disparate areas and and\\none can even think of deep mind as i\\nsaid earlier as a sort of\\ninterdisciplinary between neuroscience\\nideas and ai engineering ideas uh\\noriginally and so um so i think there's\\nthat and then one of the things we can't\\nimagine today is and one of the reasons\\ni think people we were so surprised by\\nhow well large models worked is that\\nactually\\nit's very hard for our human minds our\\nlimited human minds to understand what\\nit would be like to read the whole\\ninternet right i think we can do a\\nthought experiment and i used to do this\\nof like well what if i read the whole of\\nwikipedia\\nwhat would i know and i think our minds\\ncan just about comprehend maybe what\\nthat would be like but the whole\\ninternet is beyond comprehension so i\\nthink we just don't understand what it\\nwould be like to be able to hold all of\\nthat in mind potentially right and then\\nactive at once and then maybe what are\\nthe connections that are available there\\nso i think no doubt there are huge\\nthings to be discovered just like that\\nbut i do think there is this other type\\nof creativity of true spark of new\\nknowledge new idea never thought before\\nabout can't be average from things that\\nare known um that really of course\\neverything come you know nobody creates\\nin a vacuum so there must be clues\\nsomewhere but just a unique way of\\nputting those things together i think\\nsome of the greatest scientists in\\nhistory have displayed that i would say\\nalthough it's very hard to know going\\nback to their time what was exactly\\nknown uh when they came up with those\\nthings although\\nyou're making me really think because\\njust the thought experiment of deeply\\nknowing a hundred wikipedia pages\\ni don't think i can um\\ni've been really impressed by wikipedia\\nfor for technical topics yeah so if you\\nknow a hundred pages or a thousand pages\\ni don't think who can visually truly\\ncomprehend what's\\nwhat kind of intelligence that is that's\\na pretty powerful intelligence if you\\nknow how to use that and integrate that\\ninformation correctly yes i think you\\ncan go really far you can probably\\nconstruct thought experiments based on\\nthat\\nlike simulate different ideas so if this\\nis true let me run this thought\\nexperiment then maybe this is true it's\\nnot really invention it's like just\\ntaking literally the knowledge and using\\nit to construct a very basic simulation\\nof the world i mean some argue it's\\nromantic in part but einstein would do\\nthe same kind of things with a thought\\nexperiment yeah one could imagine doing\\nthat systematically across millions of\\nwikipedia pages plus pubmed all these\\nthings i think there are\\nmany many things to be discovered like\\nthat they're hugely useful you know you\\ncould imagine and i want us to do some\\nof those things in material science like\\nroom temperature superconductors or\\nsomething on my list one day i'd like to\\nlike you know have an ai system to help\\nbuild better optimized batteries all of\\nthese sort of mechanical things mr i\\nthink a systematic sort of search could\\nbe uh\\nguided by a model could be um could be\\nextremely powerful so speaking of which\\nyou have a paper on nuclear fusion\\nuh magnetic control of tokamak plasmas\\nto deep reinforcement learning so you uh\\nyou're seeking to solve nuclear fusion\\nwith deep rl\\nso it's doing control of high\\ntemperature plasmas can you explain this\\nwork\\nand uh can ai eventually solve nuclear\\nfusion\\nit's been very fun last year or two and\\nvery productive because we've been\\ntaking off a lot of my\\ndream projects if you like of things\\nthat i've collected over the years of\\nareas of science that i would like to i\\nthink could be very transformative if we\\nhelped accelerate and uh really\\ninteresting problems scientific\\nchallenges in of themselves\\nthis is energy so energy yes exactly so\\nenergy and climate so we talked about\\ndisease and biology as being one of the\\nbiggest places i think ai can help with\\ni think energy and climate uh is another\\none so maybe they would be my top two um\\nand fusion is one one area i think ai\\ncan help with now fusion has many\\nchallenges mostly physics material\\nscience and engineering challenges as\\nwell to build these massive fusion\\nreactors and contain the plasma and what\\nwe try to do whenever we go into a new\\nfield\\nto apply our systems is we look for um\\nwe talk to domain experts we try and\\nfind the best people in the world to\\ncollaborate with um\\nin this case in fusion we we\\ncollaborated with epfl in switzerland\\nthe swiss technical institute who are\\namazing they have a test reactor that\\nthey were willing to let us use which\\nyou know i double checked with the team\\nwe were going to use carefully and\\nsafely\\ni was impressed they managed to persuade\\nthem to let us use it and um and it's a\\nit's an amazing test reactor they have\\nthere and they try all sorts of pretty\\ncrazy experiments on it and um the the\\nthe what we tend to look at is if we go\\ninto a new domain like fusion what are\\nall the bottleneck problems uh like\\nthinking from first principles you know\\nwhat are all the bottleneck problems\\nthat are still stopping fusion working\\ntoday and then we look at we you know we\\nget a fusion expert to tell us and then\\nwe look at those bottlenecks and we look\\nat the ones which ones are amenable to\\nour ai methods today yes right and and\\nand then and would be interesting from a\\nresearch perspective from our point of\\nview from an ai point of view and that\\nwould address one of their bottlenecks\\nand in this case plasma control was was\\nperfect so you know the plasma it's a\\nmillion degrees celsius something like\\nthat it's hotter than the sun\\nand there's obviously no material that\\ncan contain it so they have to be\\ncontaining these magnetic very powerful\\nsuperconducting magnetic fields but the\\nproblem is plasma is pretty unstable as\\nyou imagine you're kind of holding a\\nmini sun mini star in a reactor so you\\nknow you you kind of want to predict\\nahead of time\\nwhat the plasma's going to do so you can\\nmove the magnetic field within a few\\nmilliseconds you know to to basically\\ncontain what it's going to do next so it\\nseems like a perfect problem if you\\nthink of it for like a reinforcement\\nlearning prediction problem so uh you\\nknow your controller you're gonna move\\nthe magnetic field and until we came\\nalong you know they were they were doing\\nit with with traditional operational uh\\nresearch type of uh controllers uh which\\nare kind of handcrafted and the problem\\nis of course they can't react in the\\nmoment to something the plasma's doing\\nthat they have to be hard-coded and\\nagain knowing that that's normally our\\ngo-to solution is we would like to learn\\nthat instead and they also had a\\nsimulator of these plasma so there were\\nlots of criteria that matched what we we\\nlike to to to use\\nso can ai eventually solve nuclear\\nfusion well so we with this problem and\\nwe published it in a nature paper last\\nyear uh we held the fusion that we held\\nthe plasma in specific shapes so\\nactually it's almost like carving the\\nplasma into different shapes and control\\nand hold it there for the record amount\\nof time so um so that's one of the\\nproblems of of fusion sort of um solved\\nso i have a controller that's able to no\\nmatter the shape uh contain it continue\\nyeah contain it and hold it in structure\\nand there's different shapes that are\\nbetter for for the energy productions\\ncalled droplets and and and so on so um\\nso that was huge and now we're looking\\nwe're talking to lots of fusion startups\\nto see what's the next problem we can\\ntackle uh in the fusion area\\nso another fascinating place\\nin a paper title pushing the frontiers\\nof density functionals by solving the\\nfractional electron problem so you're\\ntaking on\\nmodeling and simulating the quantum\\nmechanical behavior of electrons yes\\num\\ncan you explain this work and can ai\\nmodel and simulate arbitrary quantum\\nmechanical systems in the future yeah so\\nthis is another problem i've had my eye\\non for you know a decade or more which\\nis um\\nuh sort of simulating the properties of\\nelectrons if you can do that you can\\nbasically describe how elements and\\nmaterials and substances work so it's\\nkind of like fundamental if you want to\\nadvance material science um and uh you\\nknow we have schrodinger's equation and\\nthen we have approximations to that\\ndensity functional theory these things\\nare you know are famous and um people\\ntry and write approximations to to these\\nuh uh to these functionals and and kind\\nof come up with descriptions of the\\nelectron clouds where they're gonna go\\nhow they're gonna interact when you put\\ntwo elements together uh and what we try\\nto do is learn a simulation uh uh\\nlearner functional that will describe\\nmore chemistry types of chemistry so um\\nuntil now you know you can run expensive\\nsimulations but then you can only\\nsimulate very small uh molecules very\\nsimple molecules we would like to\\nsimulate large materials um and so uh\\ntoday there's no way of doing that and\\nwe're building up towards uh building\\nfunctionals that approximate\\nschrodinger's equation and then allow\\nyou to describe uh what the electrons\\nare doing\\nand all materials sort of science and\\nmaterial properties are governed by the\\nelectrons and and how they interact so\\nhave a good summarization of the\\nsimulation through the functional\\num\\nbut one that is still\\nclose to what the actual simulation\\nwould come out with so what um\\nhow difficult is that to ask what's\\ninvolved in that task is it running\\nthose\\nthose complicated simulations yeah and\\nlearning the task of mapping from the\\ninitial conditions and the parameters of\\nthe simulation learning what the\\nfunctional would be yeah so it's pretty\\ntricky and we've done it with um you\\nknow the nice thing is we there are we\\ncan run a lot of the simulations that\\nthe molecular dynamics simulations on\\nour compute clusters and so that\\ngenerates a lot of data so in this case\\nthe data is generated so we like those\\nsort of systems and that's why we use\\ngames simulator generated data\\nand we can kind of create as much of it\\nas we want really um and just let's\\nleave some you know if any computers are\\nfree in the cloud we just run we run\\nsome of these calculations right compute\\ncluster calculation that's all the the\\nfree compute times used up on quantum\\nmechanics quantum mechanics exactly\\nsimulations and protein simulations and\\nother things and so um and so you know\\nwhen you're not searching on youtube for\\nvideo cat videos we're using those\\ncomputers usefully and quantum chemistry\\nthat's the idea\\nand and putting them for good use and\\nthen yeah and then all of that\\ncomputational data that's generated we\\ncan then try and learn the functionals\\nfrom that which of course are way more\\nefficient\\nonce we learn the functional than um\\nrunning those simulations would be\\ndo you think one day ai may allow us to\\ndo something like basically crack open\\nphysics so do something like travel\\nfaster than the speed of light\\nmy ultimate aim has always been with ai\\nis\\num the reason i am personally working on\\nai for my whole life it was to build a\\ntool to help us understand stand the\\nuniverse so i wanted to and that means\\nphysics really and the nature of reality\\nso\\num\\nuh i don't think we have systems that\\nare capable of doing that yet but when\\nwe get towards agi i think um that's one\\nof the first things i think we should\\napply agi to\\ni would like to test the limits of\\nphysics and our knowledge of physics\\nthere's so many things we don't know\\nthere's one thing i find fascinating\\nabout science and you know as a huge\\nproponent of the scientific method as\\nbeing one of the greatest ideas\\nhumanity's ever had and allowed us to\\nprogress with our knowledge\\nbut i think as a true scientist i think\\nwhat you find is the more you find out\\nuh you the more you realize we don't\\nknow\\nand and i always think that it's\\nsurprising that more people don't aren't\\ntroubled you know every night i think\\nabout all these things we interact with\\nall the time that we have no idea how\\nthey work time\\nconsciousness gravity\\nlife we can't i mean these are all the\\nfundamental things of nature i think the\\nway we don't really know what they are\\nto live life we uh pin certain\\nassumptions on them and kind of treat\\nour assumptions as if they're a fact\\nyeah that allows us to sort of box them\\noff somehow yeah box them off\\nbut the reality is when you think of\\ntime\\nyou should remind yourself you should\\nput it off the sh\\ntake it off the shelf and realize like\\nno we have a bunch of assumptions\\nthere's still a lot of there's even now\\na lot of debate there's a lot of\\nuncertainty about exactly what is time\\nuh is there an error of time you know\\nthere's there's a lot of fundamental\\nquestions you can't just make\\nassumptions about and maybe\\nai allows you to um\\nnot put anything on the shelf\\nyeah not make any uh hard assumptions\\nand really open it up and see what\\nexactly i think we should be truly\\nopen-minded about that and uh exactly\\nthat not be dogmatic to a particular\\ntheory\\num it'll also allow us to build better\\ntools experimental tools eventually\\nthat can then test certain theories that\\nmay not be testable today about as\\nthings about like\\nwhat we spoke about at the beginning\\nabout the computational nature of the\\nuniverse how one might if that was true\\nhow one might go about testing that\\nright and and how much uh you know there\\nare people who've conjectured people\\nlike uh scott aronson and others about\\nuh you know how much information can a\\nspecific planck unit of space and time\\ncontain right so one might be able to\\nthink about testing those ideas if you\\nhad um\\nai helping you build some new exquisite\\nuh uh experimental tools this is what i\\nimagine you know many decades from now\\nwe'll be able to do\\nand what kind of\\nquestions can be answered through\\nrunning a simulation\\nof of them so there's a bunch of physics\\nsimulations you can imagine that could\\nbe run\\nin an uh so some kind of efficient way\\nmuch like you're doing in the quantum\\nsimulation work\\nand perhaps even the origin of life so\\nfiguring out how\\ngoing even back before the work of alpha\\nfault begins of how this whole whole\\nthing\\num emerges from a rock yes from a static\\nthing would what do you do you think ai\\nwill allow us to is that something you\\nhave your eye on it's trying to\\nunderstand the origin of life first of\\nall yourself\\nwhat do you think\\num\\nhow the heck did life originate on earth\\nyeah well maybe we i'll come to that in\\na second but i think the ultimate\\nuse of ai is to\\nkind of use it to accelerate science to\\nthe maximum so i\\num think of it a little bit like the\\ntree of all knowledge if you imagine\\nthat's all the knowledge there is in the\\nuniverse to attain\\nand we sort of barely scratched the\\nsurface of that so far in even though\\nyou know we've we've done pretty well\\nsince the enlightenment right as\\nhumanity and i think ai will turbo\\ncharge all of that like we've seen with\\nalpha fold and i want to explore as much\\nof that tree of knowledge as it's\\npossible to do and um and i think that\\ninvolves ai helping us with with with\\nunderstanding or finding patterns um but\\nalso potentially designing and building\\nnew tools experimental tools so i think\\nthat's all uh\\nand also running simulations and\\nlearning simulations all of that we're\\nalready we're sort of doing it at a at a\\nat a you know baby steps level here but\\ni can imagine that in in in the decades\\nto come as uh you know what's the full\\nflourishing of of that line of thinking\\nit's going to be truly incredible i\\nwould say if i visualize this tree of\\nknowledge something tells me that that\\nknowledge for tree of knowledge for\\nhumans is much smaller\\nin the set of all possible trees of\\nknowledge is actually quite small giving\\nour cognitive\\nlimitations\\nlimited cognitive capabilities that even\\nwith with the tools we build we still\\nwon't be able to understand a lot of\\nthings and that's perhaps what non-human\\nsystems might be able to reach farther\\nnot just as tools\\nbut in themselves understanding\\nsomething that they can bring back yeah\\nit could well be so i mean there's so\\nmany things that that are sort of\\nencapsulated in what you just said there\\ni think first of all um\\nthere's there's two different things\\nthere's like what do we understand today\\nyeah what could the human mind\\nunderstand and what is the totality of\\nwhat is there to be understood yeah\\nright and so there's three consensus you\\nknow you can think of them as three\\nlarger and larger trees or exploring\\nmore branches of that tree and i i think\\nwith ai we're going to explore that\\nwhole lot now the question is is uh you\\nknow if you think about what is the\\ntotality of what could be understood um\\nthere may be some fundamental physics\\nreasons why certain things can't be\\nunderstood like what's outside the\\nsimulation or outside the universe maybe\\nit's not understandable from within the\\nuniverse\\nso that's there may be some hard\\nconstraints like that you know it could\\nbe smaller constraints like\\num we think of space time as fundamental\\nus our human brains are really used to\\nthis idea of a three-dimensional world\\nwith time right\\nmaybe but our tools could go beyond that\\nthey wouldn't have that limitation\\nnecessary they could think in 11\\ndimensions 12 dimensions whatever is\\nneeded but um we could still maybe\\nunderstand that in several different\\nways the example i always give is um\\nwhen i you know play gary kasparov at\\nspeed chess or we've talked about chess\\nand these kind of things um you know he\\nif you if you if you're reasonably good\\nat chess you can um you can't come up\\nwith the move gary comes up with in his\\nmove but he can explain it to you and\\nyou can understand and you can\\nunderstand post hoc the reasoning yeah\\nso so i think there's a there's an even\\nfurther level of like well maybe you\\ncouldn't have invented that thing but\\nbut using like going back to using\\nlanguage again perhaps you can\\nunderstand and appreciate that same way\\nlike you can appreciate you know vivaldi\\nor mozart or something without you can\\nappreciate the beauty of that without um\\nbeing able to to construct it yourself\\nright invent the music yourself so i\\nthink we see this in all forms of life\\nso it'll be that times you know\\na million but it would you can imagine\\nalso one sign of intelligence is the\\nability to explain things clearly and\\nsimply right you know people like\\nrichard feynman another one of my\\nall-time heroes used to say that right\\nif you can't you know if you can explain\\nit something simply then you that's a\\nthat's the best sign a complex topic\\nsimply then that's one of the best signs\\nof you understanding it yeah so i can\\nsee myself talking trash in the ai\\nsystem in that way yes uh\\nit gets frustrated how dumb i am and\\ntrying to explain something to me i was\\nlike well that means you're not\\nintelligent because if you were\\nintelligent you'd be able to explain it\\nsimply yeah of course you know there's\\nalso the other option of course we could\\nenhance ourselves and and without\\ndevices we we are already sort of\\nsymbiotic with our compute devices right\\nwith our phones and other things and you\\nknow this stuff like neural link and etc\\nthat could be could could advance that\\nfurther um so i think there's lots of\\nlots of really amazing possibilities uh\\nthat i could foresee from here well let\\nme ask you some wild questions so out\\nthere\\nlooking for friends\\ndo you think there's a lot of alien\\ncivilizations out there\\nso i guess this also goes back to your\\norigin of life question too because i\\nthink that that's key\\num\\nmy personal opinion looking at all this\\nand and you know it's one of my hobbies\\nphysics i guess so so i i you know it's\\nsomething i think about a lot and talk\\nto a lot of experts on and and and read\\na lot of books on and i think\\nmy feeling currently is that that we are\\nalone i think that's the most likely\\nscenario given what what evidence we\\nhave so um and the reasoning is i think\\nthat\\nyou know we've tried since uh things\\nlike seti program and i guess since the\\ndawning of the the space age uh we've\\nyou know had telescopes open radio\\ntelescopes and other things and if you\\nthink about um and try to detect signals\\nnow if you think about the evolution of\\nhumans on earth we could have easily\\nbeen um a million years ahead of our\\ntime now or million years behind quite\\neasily with just some slightly different\\nquirk thing happening hundreds of\\nthousands years ago uh you know things\\ncould have been slightly different if\\nthe bto had hit the dinosaurs a million\\nyears earlier maybe things would have\\nevolved uh we'd be a million years\\nahead of where we are now so what that\\nmeans is if you imagine where humanity\\nwill be in a few hundred years let alone\\na million years especially if we\\nhopefully um\\nyou know solve things like climate\\nchange and other things and we continue\\nto flourish\\nand we build things like ai and we do\\nspace traveling and all of the stuff\\nthat that humans have dreamed of for\\nforever right and sci-fi has talked\\nabout forever um\\nwe will be spreading across the stars\\nright and void neumann famously\\ncalculated you know it would only take\\nabout a million years if you send out\\nvon neumann probes to the nearest you\\nknow the nearest uh uh other solar\\nsystems and and then they built all they\\ndid was build two more versions of\\nthemselves and set those two out to the\\nnext nearest systems uh you you know\\nwithin a million years i think you would\\nhave one of these probes in every system\\nin the galaxy so it's not actually in\\ncosmo cosmological time that's actually\\na very short amount of time\\nso and and you know we've people like\\ndyson have thought about constructing\\ndyson spheres around stars to collect\\nall the energy coming out of the star\\nyou know that there would be\\nconstructions like that would be visible\\nacross base um probably even across a\\ngalaxy so and then you know if you think\\nabout all of our radio television uh\\nemissions that have gone out since since\\nthe you know 30s and 40s um imagine a\\nmillion years of that and now hundreds\\nof civilizations doing that when we\\nopened our ears at the point we got\\ntechnologically sophisticated enough in\\nthe space age we should have\\nheard a cacophony of voices we should\\nhave joined that cacophony of voices and\\nwhat we did we opened our ears and we\\nheard nothing\\nand many people who argue that there are\\naliens would say well we haven't really\\ndone exhaustive search yet and maybe\\nwe're looking in the wrong bands and and\\nwe've got the wrong devices and we\\nwouldn't notice what an alien form was\\nlike to be so different to what we're\\nused to but you know i'm not i don't\\nreally buy that that it shouldn't be as\\ndifficult as that like we i think we've\\nsearched enough there should be if it\\nwere everywhere if it was it should be\\neverywhere we should see dyson's fears\\nbeing put up sun's blinking in and out\\nyou know there should be a lot of\\nevidence for those things and then there\\nare other people argue well the sort of\\nsafari view of like well we're a\\nprimitive species still because we're\\nnot space faring yet and and and we're\\nyou know there's some kind of globe like\\nuniversal rule not to interfere star\\ntrek rule but like look look we can't\\neven coordinate humans to deal with\\nclimate change and we're one species\\nwhat is the chance that of all of these\\ndifferent human civilization you know\\nalien civilizations they would have the\\nsame priorities and and and and agree\\nacross you know these kind of matters\\nand even if that was true and we were in\\nsome sort of safari for our own good to\\nme that's not much different from the\\nsimulation hypothesis because what does\\nit mean the simulation hypothesis i\\nthink in its most fundamental level it\\nmeans what we're seeing is not quite\\nreality right it's something there's\\nsomething more deeper underlying it\\nmaybe computational now if we were in a\\nif we were in a sort of safari park and\\neverything we were seeing was a hologram\\nand it was projected by the aliens or\\nwhatever that to me is not much\\ndifferent than thinking we're inside of\\nanother universe because we still can't\\nsee true reality right i mean there's\\nthere's other explanations it could be\\nthat\\nthe way they're communicating is just\\nfundamentally different that we're too\\ndumb to understand the much better\\nmethods of communication they have it\\ncould be i mean i mean it's silly to say\\nbut\\nour own thoughts could be the methods by\\nwhich they're communicating like the\\nplace from which our ideas writers talk\\nabout this like the muse yeah\\nit sounds like very kind of uh\\nwild but it could be thoughts it could\\nbe\\nsome interactions with our mind that we\\nthink are originating from\\nus is actually something that uh\\nis coming from other life forms\\nelsewhere consciousness itself might be\\nthat it could be but i don't see any\\nsensible argument to the why why would\\nall of the alien species be using this\\nway yes some of them will be more\\nprimitive they would be close to our\\nlevel you know there would there should\\nbe a whole sort of normal distribution\\nof these things right some would be\\naggressive some would be you know\\ncurious others would be very stoical and\\nphilosophical because you know maybe\\nthey're a million years older than us\\nbut it's not it shouldn't be like what i\\nmean one one alien civilization might be\\nlike that communicating thoughts and\\nothers but i don't see why you know\\npotentially the hundreds there should be\\nwould be uniform in this way right it\\ncould be a violent dictatorship that the\\nthe people the alien civilizations that\\nuh become successful\\nbecome um\\n[Music]\\ngain the ability to be destructive an\\norder of magnitude more destructive\\nbut of course the the sad thought\\nwell\\neither humans are very special we took a\\nlot of leaps that arrived at what it\\nmeans to be human yeah\\num\\nthere's a question there which was the\\nhardest which was the most special but\\nalso if others have reached this level\\nand maybe many others have reached this\\nlevel\\nthe great filter\\nthat prevented them from going farther\\nto becoming a multi-planetary species or\\nreaching out into the stars\\nand those are really important questions\\nfor us whether\\num\\nwhether there's other alien\\ncivilizations out there or not this is\\nvery useful for us to think about if we\\ndestroy ourselves\\nhow will we do it and how easy is it to\\ndo yeah well you know these are big\\nquestions and i've thought about these a\\nlot but the the the interesting thing is\\nthat if we're if we're alone\\nthat's somewhat comforting from the\\ngreat filter perspective because it\\nprobably means the great filters were\\nare past us and i'm pretty sure they are\\nso that by in going back to your origin\\nof life question there are some\\nincredible things that no one knows how\\nhappened like obviously the first\\nlife form from chemical soup that seems\\npretty hard but i would guess the\\nmulticellular i wouldn't be that\\nsurprised if we saw single\\nsingle cell sort of life forms elsewhere\\nuh bacteria type things but\\nmulticellular life seems incredibly hard\\nthat step of you know capturing\\nmitochondria and then sort of using that\\nas part of yourself you know when you've\\njust eaten it would you say that's the\\nbiggest\\nthe most uh like\\nif if you had to choose one sort of uh\\nhitchhiker's got this galaxy one\\nsentence summary of like oh those clever\\ncreatures did this that would be the\\nmultilist i think that was probably the\\none that that's the biggest i mean\\nthere's a great book called the 10 grand\\ngreat inventions of evolution by nick\\nlane and he speculates on 10 10 of these\\nyou know what could be great filters um\\ni think that's one i think the the\\nadvent of of intelligence and and\\nconscious intelligence and in order you\\nknow to us to be able to do science and\\nthings like that is huge as well i mean\\nit's only evolved once as far as you\\nknow uh in in earth history so that\\nwould be a later candidate but there's\\ncertainly for the early candidates i\\nthink multicellular life forms is huge\\nby the way what it's interesting to ask\\nyou if you can hypothesize about\\nwhat is the origin of intelligence is it\\nuh\\nthat we started\\ncooking meat over fire\\nis it that we somehow figured out that\\nwe could be very powerful when we start\\ncollaborating so cooperation between\\num our ancestors\\nso that we can overthrow the alpha male\\nuh what is it richard i talked to\\nrichard randham who thinks we're all\\njust beta males who figured out how to\\ncollaborate to defeat the one the\\ndictator the authoritarian alpha male\\num that control the tribe um is there\\nother explanation did was there um 2001\\nspace out any type of monolith yeah that\\ncame down to earth well i i think um i\\nthink all of those things you suggest\\nfor good candidates fire and and and\\ncooking right so that's clearly\\nimportant\\nyou know energy efficiency yeah cooking\\nour meat and then and then being able to\\nto to be more efficient about eating it\\nand getting it consuming the energy um i\\nthink that's huge and then utilizing\\nfire and tools i think you're right\\nabout the the tribal cooperation aspects\\nand probably language as part of that\\nyes um because probably that's what\\nallowed us to outcompete neanderthals\\nand and perhaps less cooperative species\\nso um so that may be the case tool\\nmaking spears axes i think that let us i\\nmean i think it's pretty clear now that\\nhumans were responsible for a lot of the\\nextinctions of megafauna um especially\\nin in the americas when humans arrived\\nso uh you can imagine once you discover\\ntool usage how powerful that would have\\nbeen and how scary for animals so i\\nthink all of those could have been\\nexplanations for it you know the\\ninteresting thing is that it's a bit\\nlike general intelligence too is it's\\nvery costly to begin with to have a\\nbrain\\nand especially a general purpose brain\\nrather than a special purpose one\\nbecause the amount of energy our brains\\nuse i think it's like 20 of the body's\\nenergy and it's it's massive and when\\nyou're thinking chest one of the funny\\nthings that that we used to say is as\\nmuch as a racing driver uses for a whole\\nyou know formula one race if just\\nplaying a game of you know serious high\\nlevel chess which you you know you\\nwouldn't think just sitting there um\\nbecause the brain's using so much uh\\nenergy so in order for an animal an\\norganism to justify that there has to be\\na huge payoff and the problem with with\\nhalf a brain or half you know\\nintelligence saying iqs of you know\\nof like a monkey brain it's\\nit's not clear you can justify that\\nevolutionary until you get to the human\\nlevel brain and so but how do you how do\\nyou do that jump it's very difficult\\nwhich is why i think it's only been done\\nonce from the sort of specialized brains\\nthat you see in animals to this sort of\\ngeneral purpose chewing powerful brains\\nthat humans have um and which allows us\\nto invent the modern modern world um and\\nuh you know it takes a lot to to cross\\nthat barrier and i think we've seen the\\nsame with ai systems which is that uh\\nmaybe until very recently it's always\\nbeen easier to craft a specific solution\\nto a problem like chess than it has been\\nto build a general learning system that\\ncould potentially do many things because\\ninitially uh that system will be way\\nworse than uh less efficient than the\\nspecialized system so one of the\\ninteresting\\nquirks of the human mind of this evolved\\nsystem is that it appears to be\\nconscious\\nthis thing that we don't quite\\nunderstand but it seems very\\nvery special its ability to have a\\nsubjective experience that it feels like\\nsomething\\nto eat a cookie the deliciousness of it\\nor see a color and that kind of stuff do\\nyou think in order to solve intelligence\\nwe also need to solve consciousness\\nalong the way do you think agi systems\\nneed to have consciousness in order to\\nbe\\ntruly intelligent yeah we thought about\\nthis a lot actually and um i think that\\nmy guess is that consciousness and\\nintelligence are double dissociable so\\nyou can have one without the other both\\nways and i think you can see that with\\nconsciousness in that i think some\\nanimals and pets if you have a pet dog\\nor something like that you can see some\\nof the higher animals and dolphins\\nthings like that are uh have\\nself-awareness and uh very sociable um\\nseem to dream um you know those kinds of\\na lot of the traits one would regard as\\nbeing kind of conscious and self-aware\\num and but yet they're not that smart\\nright uh so they're not that intelligent\\nby by say iq standards or something like\\nthat yeah it's also possible that our\\nunderstanding of intelligence is flawed\\nlike putting an iq to it sure maybe the\\nthing that a dog can do\\nis actually gone very far along the path\\nof intelligence and we humans are just\\nable to\\nplay chess and maybe write poems right\\nbut if we go back to the idea of agi and\\ngeneral intelligence you know dogs are\\nvery specialized right most animals are\\npretty specialized they can be amazing\\nat what they do but they're like kind of\\nelite sports sports people or something\\nright so they do one thing extremely\\nwell because their entire brain is is\\noptimized they have somehow convinced\\nthe entirety of the human population to\\nfeed them and service them so in some\\nway they're controlling yes exactly well\\nwe co-evolved to some crazy degree right\\nuh including the the way the dogs you\\nknow even even wag their tails and\\ntwitch their noses right we find we're\\nfinding inexorably cute yeah um but i\\nthink um you can also see intelligence\\non the other side so systems like\\nartificial systems that are amazingly\\nsmart at certain things like maybe\\nplaying go and chess and other things\\nbut they don't feel at all in any shape\\nor form conscious in the way that you\\nknow you do to me or i do to you and um\\nand i think actually\\nbuilding ai\\nis uh these intelligent constructs uh is\\none of the best ways to explore the\\nmystery of consciousness to break it\\ndown because um we're going to have\\ndevices that are\\npretty smart at certain things or\\ncapable of certain things but\\npotentially won't have any semblance of\\nself-awareness or other things and in\\nfact i would advocate\\nif there's a choice building systems in\\nthe first place ai systems that are not\\nconscious to begin with uh are just\\ntools um until we understand them better\\nand the capabilities better so on that\\ntopic just not\\nas the ceo of deep mind\\njust as a human being let me ask you\\nabout this one particular anecdotal\\nevidence of the google engineer\\nwho made a comment\\nor\\nbelieved that there's some aspect of a\\nlanguage model\\nthe lambda language model that exhibited\\nsentience\\nso you said you believe there might be a\\nresponsibility to build systems that are\\nnot essential and this experience of a\\nparticular engineer i think i'd love to\\nget your general opinion on this kind of\\nthing but i think it will happen more\\nand more and more\\nwhich uh not when engineers but when\\npeople out there that don't have an\\nengineering background start interacting\\nwith increasingly intelligent systems\\nwe anthropomorphize them they they start\\nto have deep impactful\\num interactions with us in a way that we\\nmiss them yeah when they're gone\\nand\\nwe sure feel like they're\\nliving entities self-aware entities and\\nmaybe even we project sentience onto\\nthem so what what's your thought about\\nthis particular\\nuh system was is uh\\nhave you ever met a language model\\nthat's sentient\\nno i no no what do you make of the case\\nof when you kind of\\nfeel\\nthat there's some elements of sentience\\nto this system yeah so this is you know\\nan interesting question and uh uh\\nobviously a very fundamental one so\\nfirst thing to say is i think that\\nnone of the systems we have today i i\\nwould say even have one iota of uh\\nsemblance of consciousness or sentience\\nthat's my personal feeling interacting\\nwith them every day so i think that's\\nway premature to be discussing what that\\nengineer talked about i appreciate i\\nthink at the moment it's more of a\\nprojection of the way our own minds work\\nwhich is to see\\nuh uh uh sort of purpose and direction\\nin almost anything that we you know our\\nbrains are trained to interpret uh\\nagency basically in things uh even the\\nan inanimate thing sometimes and of\\ncourse with a a language system because\\nlanguage is so fundamental to\\nintelligence that's going to be easy for\\nus to anthropomorphize that\\ni mean back in the day even the first uh\\nyou know the dumbest sort of template\\nchatbots ever eliza and and and and the\\nilk of the original chatbots back in the\\n60s fooled some people under certain\\ncircumstances right they pretended to be\\na psychologist so just basically rabbit\\nback to you the same question you asked\\nit back to you um\\nand uh some people believe that so i\\ndon't think we can this is why i think\\nthe turing test is a little bit flawed\\nas a formal test because it depends on\\nthe sophistication of the of the judge\\num whether or not they are qualified to\\nmake that distinction so\\ni think we should uh talk to you know\\nthe the top philosophers about this\\npeople like daniel dennett and uh david\\nchalmers and others who've obviously\\nthought deeply about consciousness of\\ncourse consciousness itself hasn't been\\nwell there's no agreed definition if i\\nwas to you know uh speculate about that\\nuh you know i kind of the definite the\\nworking definition i like is it's the\\nway information feels when you know it\\ngets processed i think maybe max tegmark\\ncame up with that i like that idea i\\ndon't know if it helps us get towards\\nany more operational thing but but it's\\nit's it's i think it's a nice way of\\nviewing it um i think we can obviously\\nsee from neuroscience certain\\nprerequisites that are required like\\nself-awareness i think is necessary but\\nnot sufficient component this idea of a\\nself and other and set of coherent\\npreferences that are coherent over time\\nyou know these things are maybe memory\\num these things are probably needed for\\na sentient or conscious being um but but\\nthe reason that the difficult thing i\\nthink for us when we get and i think\\nthis is a really interesting\\nphilosophical debate is when we get\\ncloser to agi and and and you know\\nand and much more powerful systems than\\nwe have today\\num how are we going to make this\\njudgment and one way which is the turing\\ntest is sort of a behavioral judgment is\\nis the system exhibiting all the\\nbehaviors um that a human sentient uh or\\na sentient being would would would\\nexhibit um is it answering the right\\nquestions is it saying the right things\\nis it indistinguishable from a human um\\nand so on\\nbut i think there's a second thing that\\nmakes us as humans regard each other as\\nsentient right why do we why do we think\\nthis and i debated this with daniel\\ndennett and i think there's a second\\nreason that's often overlooked which is\\nthat we're running on the same substrate\\nright so if we're exhibiting the same\\nbehavior uh more or less as humans and\\nwe're running on the same you know\\ncarbon-based biological substrate the\\nsquishy you know few pounds of of flesh\\nin our skulls then the most parsimonious\\ni think explanation is that you're\\nfeeling the same thing as i'm feeling\\nright but we will never have that second\\npart the substrate equivalence with a\\nmachine\\nright so we will have to only judge\\nbased on the behavior and i think the\\nsubstrate equivalence is a critical part\\nof why we make assumptions that we're\\nconscious and in fact even with with\\nanimals high-level animals why we think\\nthey might be because they're exhibiting\\nsome of the behaviors we would expect\\nfrom a sentient animal and we know\\nthey're made of the same things\\nbiological neurons so we're gonna have\\nto come up with\\nexplanations uh or models of the gap\\nbetween substrate differences between\\nmachines and humans did to get anywhere\\nbeyond the behavioral but to me sort of\\nthe practical question is\\nvery interesting and very important when\\nyou have millions perhaps billions of\\npeople believing that you have ascension\\nai believing what that google engineer\\nbelieved\\nwhich i just see is an obvious\\nvery near-term future thing certainly on\\nthe path to agi\\nhow does that change the world\\nwhat's the responsibility of the ai\\nsystem to help those millions of people\\nand also what's the ethical thing\\nbecause\\nyou can you can make a lot of people\\nhappy\\nby creating a meaningful deep experience\\nwith a system\\nthat's faking it before it makes it yeah\\nand i i don't\\nis a are we the right or who is to say\\nwhat's the right thing to do should ai\\nalways be tools like why why why are we\\nconstraining ais to always be tools as\\nopposed to\\nfriends yeah i think well i mean these\\nare you know you know fantastic\\nquestions and and also critical ones and\\nwe've been thinking about this uh since\\nthe start of d minor before that because\\nwe planned for success and you know how\\nhow you know you know however remote\\nthat looked like back in 2010 and we've\\nalways had sort of these ethical\\nconsiderations as fundamental at\\ndeepmind um and my current thinking on\\nthe language models is and and large\\nmodels is they're not ready we don't\\nunderstand them well enough yet um and\\nyou know in terms of analysis tools and\\nand guard rails what they can and can't\\ndo and so on to deploy them at scale\\nbecause i think you know there are big\\nstill ethical questions like should an\\nai system always announce that it is an\\nai system to begin with probably yes um\\nit what what do you do about answering\\nthose philosophical questions about the\\nfeelings uh people may have about ai\\nsystems perhaps incorrectly attributed\\nso i think there's a whole bunch of\\nresearch that needs to be done first um\\nto responsibly before you know you can\\nresponsibly deploy these systems at\\nscale that would be at least be my\\ncurrent position\\nover time i'm very confident we'll have\\nthose tools like interpretability\\nquestions um\\nand uh analysis questions uh and then\\nwith the ethical quandary you know i\\nthink there\\nit's important to\\nuh look beyond just science that's why i\\nthink philosophy social sciences even\\ntheology other things like that come\\ninto it where um what you know arts and\\nhumanities what what does it mean to be\\nhuman and the spirit of being human and\\nand to enhance that and and the human\\ncondition right and allow us to\\nexperience things we could never\\nexperience before and improve the the\\noverall human condition and humanity\\noverall you know get radical abundance\\nsolve many scientific problems solve\\ndisease so this is the era i think this\\nis the amazing era i think we're heading\\ninto if we do it right um but we've got\\nto be careful we've already seen with\\nthings like social media how dual use\\ntechnologies can be misused by firstly\\nby by by bad you know p bad actors or\\nnaive actors or crazy actors right so\\nthere's that set of just the common or\\ngarden misuse of existing dual use\\ntechnology and then of course there's an\\nadditional uh uh thing that has to be\\novercome with ai that eventually it may\\nhave its own agency so it could be uh uh\\nuh good or bad in in in of itself so i\\nthink these questions have to be\\napproached very carefully um using the\\nscientific method i would say in terms\\nof hypothesis generation careful control\\ntesting not live a b testing out in the\\nworld because with powerful dual\\ntechnologies like ai\\nif something goes wrong it may cause you\\nknow a lot of harm before you can fix it\\num it's not like a you know an imaging\\napp or game app where you know that if\\nif something goes wrong it's relatively\\neasy to fix and and the harm's\\nrelatively small so i think\\nit comes with you know the the the usual\\nuh cliche of like with a lot of power\\ncomes a lot of responsibility and i\\nthink that's the case here with things\\nlike ai given the the enormous\\nopportunity in front of us and i think\\nwe need a lot of voices uh and as many\\ninputs into things like the design of\\nthe systems and the values\\nthey should have and what goals should\\nthey be put to um i think as wide a\\ngroup of voices as possible beyond just\\nthe technologies is needed uh to input\\ninto that and to have a say in that\\nespecially when it comes to deployment\\nof these systems which is when the\\nrubber really hits the road it really\\naffects the general person in the street\\nrather than fundamental research and\\nthat's why i say\\ni think as a first step it would be\\nbetter if we have the choice to build\\nthese systems as tools to give and i'm\\nnot saying that it should never they\\nshould never go beyond tools because of\\ncourse the potential is there um for it\\nto go way beyond just tools uh but um i\\nthink that would be a good first step\\nin order for us to you know allow us to\\ncarefully experiment understand what\\nthese things can do so the leap between\\ntool to sentient entity being is one\\nshould take very careful yes\\nlet me ask a dark personal question\\nso you're one of the most brilliant\\npeople in the ag community also one of\\nthe most\\nkind\\nand uh if i may say sort of loved people\\nin the community that said\\nuh\\ncreation of a super intelligent ai\\nsystem\\nwould be one of the most\\npowerful\\nthings in the world tools or otherwise\\nand again as the old saying goes power\\ncorrupts and absolute power crops\\nabsolutely\\nyou are\\nlikely\\nto be one of the people\\ni would say probably the most likely\\nperson to be in the control of such a\\nsystem\\ndo you think about\\nthe corrupting nature of power when you\\ntalk about these kinds of systems that\\num as all dictators\\nand people have caused atrocities in the\\npast always think they're doing good\\nbut they don't do good because the\\npowers polluted their mind about what is\\ngood and what is evil do you think about\\nthis stuff or are we just focused on\\nlanguage modeling no i think about them\\nall the time and you know i think\\nwhat are the defenses against that i\\nthink one thing is to remain very\\ngrounded and sort of humble uh no matter\\nwhat you do or achieve and i try to do\\nthat i might you know my best friends\\nare still my set of friends from my\\nundergraduate cambridge days my family's\\nyou know and and friends are very\\nimportant\\num\\ni've always i think trying to be a\\nmulti-disciplinary person it helps to\\nkeep you humble because no matter how\\ngood you are at one topic someone will\\nbe better than you at that and it and\\nalways relearning a new topic again from\\nscratch is or new field is very humbling\\nright so for me that's been biology over\\nthe last five years you know huge area\\ntopic and and and it's been and i just\\nlove doing that but it helps to keep you\\ngrounded like it keeps you open-minded\\nand\\nand then the other important thing is to\\nhave a really good amazing set of uh\\npeople around you at your company or\\nyour organization who are also very\\nethical and grounded themselves and help\\nto keep you that way\\nand then ultimately just to answer your\\nquestion i hope we're going to be a big\\npart of of birthing ai and that being\\nthe greatest benefit to humanity of any\\ntool or technology ever and and getting\\nus into a world of radical abundance and\\ncuring diseases and\\nand and solving many of the big\\nchallenges we have in front of us and\\nthen ultimately you know help the\\nultimate flourishing of humanity to\\ntravel the stars and find those aliens\\nif they are there and if they're not\\nthere find out why they're not there\\nwhat what is going on here in the\\nuniverse um this is all to come and and\\nthat's what i've always dreamed about um\\nbut i don't think i think ai is too big\\nan idea it's not going to be uh there'll\\nbe a certain set of pioneers who get\\nthere first i hope\\nwe're in the vanguard so we can\\ninfluence how that goes and i think it\\nmatters who builds who which which\\ncultures they come from and what values\\nthey have uh the builders of ai systems\\nbecause i think even though the ai\\nsystem is going to learn for itself most\\nof its knowledge there'll be a residue\\nin the system of the culture and the\\nvalues of the creators of the system um\\nand there's interesting questions to to\\ndiscuss about that geopolitically you\\nknow different cultures as we're in a\\nmore fragmented world than ever\\nunfortunately i think in terms of global\\ncooperation\\nwe see that in things like climate where\\nwe can't seem to get our act together uh\\nglobally to cooperate on these pressing\\nmatters i hope that will change over\\ntime perhaps you know if we get to an\\nera of radical abundance we don't have\\nto be so competitive anymore maybe we\\ncan be more cooperative\\nif resources aren't so scarce it's true\\nthat\\nin terms of\\npower corrupting and leading to\\ndestructive things it seems that some of\\nthe atrocities of the past happen when\\nthere's a significant\\nconstraint on resources i think that's\\nthe first thing i don't think that's\\nenough i think scarcity is one thing\\nthat's led to competition destruct you\\nknow sort of zero sum game thinking i\\nwould like us to all be in a positive\\nsum world and i think for that you have\\nto remove scarcity i don't think that's\\nenough unfortunately to get world peace\\nbecause there's also other corrupting\\nthings like wanting power over people\\nand this kind of stuff which is not\\nnecessarily satisfied by by just\\nabundance but i think it will help um\\nand i think uh but i think ultimately ai\\nis not going to be run by any one person\\nor one organization i think it should\\nbelong to the world belong to humanity\\num and i think maybe many there'll be\\nmany ways this will happen and\\nultimately um\\neverybody should have a say in that\\ndo you have advice\\nfor uh young people in high school and\\ncollege maybe um\\nif they're interested in ai or\\ninterested in having a\\nbig impact on the world what they should\\ndo to have a career they can be proud of\\nher to have a life they can be proud of\\ni love giving talks to the next\\ngeneration what i say to them is\\nactually two things i i think the most\\nimportant things to learn about and to\\nfind out about when you're when you're\\nyoung is what are your true passions is\\nfirst of all there's two things one is\\nfind your true passions and i think you\\ncan do that by the way to do that is to\\nexplore as many things as possible when\\nyou're young and you you have the time\\nand you and you can take those risks um\\ni would also encourage people to look at\\nthe finding the connections between\\nthings\\nin a unique way i think that's a really\\ngreat way to find a passion second thing\\ni would say advise is know yourself so\\nspend a lot of time\\nunderstanding how you work best like\\nwhat are the optimal times to work what\\nare the optimal ways that you study um\\nwhat are your how do you deal with\\npressure\\nsort of test yourself in various\\nscenarios and try and improve your\\nweaknesses but also find out what your\\nunique skills and strengths are and then\\nhone those so then that's what will be\\nyour super value in the world later on\\nand if you can then combine those two\\nthings and find passions that you're\\ngenuinely excited about that intersect\\nwith what your unique strong skills are\\nthen you're you know you're on to\\nsomething incredible and and you know i\\nthink you can make a huge difference in\\nthe world so let me ask about know\\nyourself this is fun this is fun quick\\nquestions about day in the life the\\nperfect day the perfect productive day\\nin the life of demise's house yeah maybe\\nuh maybe these days you're um\\nthere's a lot involved yeah it may be a\\nslightly younger\\nyou could focus on a demonstration\\nproject maybe um\\nhow early do you wake up are you night\\nowl do you wake up early in the morning\\nwhat are some interesting habits\\nuh how many dozens of cups of coffees do\\nyou drink a day what's the computer um\\nthat you use\\nuh what's the setup how many screens\\nwhat kind of keyboard are we talking uh\\nemacs vim are we talking something more\\nmodern so it's a bunch of those\\nquestions so maybe uh day in the life\\nwhat what's the perfect day involved\\nwell these days it's quite different\\nfrom say 10 20 years ago back 10 20\\nyears ago it would have been you know a\\nwhole day of\\nresearch individual research or\\nprogramming doing some experiment\\nneuroscience computer science experiment\\nreading lots of research papers uh and\\nthen perhaps at night time you know um\\nreading science fiction books or or uh\\nplaying uh some games but lots of focus\\nso like deep focused work on whether\\nit's uh\\nprogramming or reading research paper\\nyes yes so that would be a lot of\\ndebrief you know uh focused work these\\ndays for the last sort of i guess you\\nknow five to ten years i've actually got\\nquite a structure that works very well\\nfor me now which is that um i'm a night\\ncomplete night out always have been so i\\noptimized for that so you know i get you\\nknow i basically do a normal day's work\\nget into work about 11 o'clock and sort\\nof do work to about seven uh in the\\noffice uh and i will arrange\\nback-to-back meetings for the entire\\ntime of that and with as many me as many\\npeople as possible so that's my\\ncollaboration management part of the day\\nthen i go home uh spend time with the\\nfamily and friends uh have dinner uh uh\\nrelax a little bit and then i start a\\nsecond day of work i call it my second\\nday work around 10 pm 11 p.m and that's\\nthe time till about the small hours of\\nthe morning four five in the morning\\nwhere i will do my thinking and reading\\na research writing research papers um\\nsadly don't have time to code anymore\\nbut it's it's not efficient to to do\\nthat uh these days uh given the amount\\nof time i have um but that's when i do\\nyou know maybe do the long kind of\\nstretches of of thinking and planning\\nand then probably you know using using\\nemail or other things i would set i\\nwould fire off a lot of things to my\\nteam to deal with the next morning for\\nactually thinking about this overnight\\nwe should go for this project or arrange\\nthis meeting the next day when you're\\nthinking through a problem are you\\ntalking about a sheet of paper or the\\npatent pen is there some independent\\nstructure yeah i like processes i still\\nlike pencil and paper best for working\\nout things but um these days it's just\\nso efficient to read research papers\\njust on the screen i still often print\\nthem out actually i still prefer to\\nmark out things and i find it goes into\\nthe brain quick better and sticks in the\\nbrain better when you're you're still\\nusing physical pen and pencil and paper\\nso you take notes with the i have lots\\nof nodes electronic ones and also um\\nwhole stacks of notebooks that\\num that i use at home yeah on some of\\nthese most challenging next steps for\\nexample stuff\\nnone of us know about that you're\\nworking on you're thinking\\nthere's some deep thinking required\\nthere right like what what is the right\\nproblem what is the right approach\\nbecause you're gonna have to invest a\\nhuge amount of time for the whole team\\nthey're going to have to pursue this\\nthing what's the right way to do it is\\nis rl going to work here or not yes um\\nwhat's the right thing to try what's the\\nright benchmark to use yeah we need to\\nconstruct a benchmark from scratch all\\nthose kinds of things yes so i think all\\nthose kind of things in the night time\\nphase but also much more um i find i've\\nalways found the quiet hours of the\\nmorning um when everyone's asleep it's\\nsuper quiet outside um i love that time\\nit's the golden hours like between like\\none and three in the morning um put some\\nmusic on some inspiring music on and\\nthen um think these deep thoughts so\\nthat's when i would read you know my\\nphilosophy books and uh spinoza's my you\\nknow recent favorite can all these\\nthings i i i you know read about a great\\nuh uh\\na scientist of history how they did\\nthings how they thought things so that's\\nwhen you do all your create that's when\\ni do all my creative thinking and it's\\ngood i think i think people recommend\\nyou know you do your your your sort of\\ncreative thinking in one block and the\\nway i organize the day that way i don't\\nget interrupted because obviously no one\\nelse is up uh at those times so i can i\\ncan go uh you know as i can sort of get\\nsuper deep and super into flow the other\\nnice thing about doing it night time\\nwise is if i'm really uh onto something\\nor i've i've got really deep into\\nsomething i can choose to extend it and\\ni'll go into six in the morning whatever\\nand then i'll just pay for it the next\\nday yeah cause i'll be a bit tired and i\\nwon't be my best but that's fine i can\\ndecide looking at my schedule the next\\nday that and given where i'm at with\\nthis particular thought or creative idea\\nthat i'm going to pay that cost the next\\nday so so i think that's that's more\\nflexible than morning people who do that\\nyou know they get up at four in the\\nmorning they can also do those golden\\nhours then but then their start of their\\nschedule day starts at breakfast you\\nknow 8 a.m whatever they have their\\nfirst meeting and then it's hard you\\nhave to reschedule a day if you're in\\nflow yeah that's going to be i don't\\nhave to see that special threat of\\nthoughts that\\nthe\\nyou're too passionate about you that\\nthis is where some of the greatest ideas\\ncould potentially come is when you just\\nlose yourself late into yeah\\nand for the meetings i mean you're\\nloading in really hard problems in a\\nvery short amount of time so you have to\\ndo some kind of first principles\\nthinking here it's like what's the\\nproblem what's the state of things\\nwhat's the right next step yes you have\\nto get really good at context switching\\nwhich is one of the hardest things\\nbecause especially as we do so many\\nthings if you include all the scientific\\nthings we do scientific fields we're\\nworking in these are entire you know\\ncomplex fields in themselves and you you\\nhave to sort of keep up to abreast of\\nthat but i enjoy it i've always been uh\\na sort of generalist in a way and that's\\nactually what happened with my games\\ncareer after chess i i i one of the\\nreasons i stopped playing chess was that\\ni got into computers but also i started\\nrealizing there were many other great\\ngames out there to play too so\\ni've always been that way inclined\\nmultidisciplinary and there's too many\\ninteresting things in in the world to\\nspend all your time just on one thing\\nso you mentioned spinoza gotta ask the\\nbig\\nridiculously big question about life\\nwhat do you think is the meaning of this\\nwhole thing\\nuh why are we humans here you've already\\nmentioned that perhaps the universe\\ncreated us\\nis that why you think we're here\\nto understand how the universe yeah i\\nthink my answer to that would be and at\\nleast the the life i'm living is to gain\\nand uh to gain and understand the\\nknowledge you know to gain knowledge and\\nunderstand the universe that's what i\\nthink uh i can't see any higher purpose\\nthan that if you think back to the\\nclassical greeks you know the virtue of\\ngaining knowledge it's uh i think it's\\nthat it's one of the few true virtues is\\nto understand um the world around us and\\nthe context and humanity better and um\\nand i think if you do that you become\\nmore compassionate and more\\nunderstanding yourself and and more\\ntolerant and all these i think all these\\nother things may flow from that and to\\nme\\nyou know understanding the nature of\\nreality that is the biggest question\\nwhat is going on here is sometimes the\\ncolloquial way i say what is really\\ngoing on here\\nuh it's so mysterious i feel like we're\\nin some huge puzzle and and it's but the\\nworld is also seems to be the universe\\nseems to be structured in a way you know\\nwhy is it structured in a way that\\nscience is even possible that you know\\nmethods the scientific method works\\nthings are repeatable\\num it feels like it's almost structured\\nin a way to be conducive to gaining\\nknowledge so i feel like and you know\\nwhy should computers be even possible\\nisn't that amazing that uh computational\\nelectronic devices can can can can be\\npossible and they're made of sand our\\nmost you know common element that we\\nhave you know silicon that on the on the\\nearth's crust they could be made of\\ndiamond or something then we would have\\nonly had one computer yeah right so it's\\na lot of things are kind of slightly\\nsuspicious to me it sure as heck sounds\\nthis puzzle sure sounds like something\\nwe talked about earlier what it takes to\\nto design a game\\nthat's really fun to play for prolonged\\nperiods of time\\nand it does seem like this puzzle like\\nyou mentioned the more you learn about\\nit the more you realize how little you\\nknow\\nso it humbles you but excites you by the\\npossibility of learning more it's one\\nheck of a one heck of a puzzle we got\\ngoing on here um so like i mentioned of\\nall the people in the world you're very\\nlikely to be the one who creates the agi\\nsystem\\num that achieves human level\\nintelligence and goes beyond it so if\\nyou got a chance and very well you could\\nbe the person that goes into the room\\nwith the system and have a conversation\\nmaybe you only get to ask one question\\nif you do\\nwhat question would you ask her\\ni would probably ask um what is the true\\nnature of reality\\ni think that's the question i don't know\\nif i'd understand the answer because\\nmaybe it would be 42 or something like\\nthat but um that's the question i would\\nask\\nand then there'll be a deep sigh from\\nthe systems like all right how do i\\nexplain to the excuse me exactly all\\nright let me i don't have time\\nto explain uh maybe i'll draw you a\\npicture that it is\\ni mean how do you even begin\\num\\nto answer that question\\nwell i think it would um what would you\\nwhat would you think the answer could\\npossibly look like i think it could it\\ncould start looking like\\nuh\\nuh more fundamental explanations of\\nphysics would be the beginning you know\\nmore careful specification of that\\ntaking you walking us through by the\\nhand as to what one would do to maybe\\nprove those things out maybe giving you\\nglimpses of\\nwhat things you totally missed in the\\nphysics of today\\nexactly just here here's glimpses of no\\nlike there's a much\\nuh\\na much more elaborate world or a much\\nsimpler world or something\\na much deeper maybe simpler explanation\\nyes of things right than the standard\\nmodel of physics which we know doesn't\\nwork but we still keep adding to so um\\nand and that's how i think the beginning\\nof an explanation would look and it\\nwould start encompassing many of the\\nmysteries that we have wondered about\\nfor thousands of years like you know\\nconsciousness\\nuh life and gravity all of these things\\nyeah giving us a glimpses of\\nexplanations for those things yeah\\nwell um\\ndamas dear one of the special\\nhuman beings in this giant puzzle of\\nours and it's a huge honor that you\\nwould take a pause from the bigger\\npuzzle to solve this small puzzle of a\\nconversation with me today it's truly an\\nhonor and a pleasure thank you thank you\\ni really enjoyed it thanks lex\\nthanks for listening to this\\nconversation with demas establish to\\nsupport this podcast please check out\\nour sponsors in the description\\nand now let me leave you with some words\\nfrom edskar dykstra\\ncomputer science is no more about\\ncomputers\\nthan astronomy is about telescopes\\nthank you for listening and hope to see\\nyou next time\")]\n"

      "how it was built and so on so i think um\n",
      "you know we should probably move away\n",

      "towards a general test where we test the\n",
      "ai capabilities on a range of tasks and\n",

      "performance on maybe thousands perhaps\n",
      "even millions of tasks eventually and\n",

      "for its time it was an amazing thought\n",
      "experiment and also 1950s obviously it\n",
      "was barely the dawn of the computer age\n",
      "so of course he only thought about text\n",
      "and now um we have a lot more different\n",

      "very formative book i bought which was\n",

      "that that brought me into ai and then\n",
      "the second part was later on uh when i\n",

      "just as a brief tangent\n",
      "well look i think um\n",
      "games uh games have been significant in\n",
      "my life for three reasons so first of\n",
      "all to to i was playing them and\n",
      "training myself on games when i was a\n",

      "all the games i i professionally wrote\n",
      "uh had ai as a core component and that\n",

      "reason i was doing that in games\n",
      "industry was at the time the games\n",
      "industry i think was the cutting edge of\n",
      "technology so whether it was graphics\n",

      "learning in a computer game so in that\n",

      "yeah and it sort of learned from how you\n",

      "unique medium because um you as the\n",

      "you're actually actively involved as an\n",

Specifically, it talks about AlphaZero, which learned to play the game of Go better than any human, and AlphaFold 2, which solved protein folding. Both of these tasks were considered nearly impossible for a long time. \\n\\nSo, from this, I can gather that DeepMind is a company focused on developing advanced artificial intelligence systems. They've made significant breakthroughs in AI, as evidenced by their work on AlphaZero and AlphaFold 2. These achievements highlight their expertise in creating AI that can perform complex tasks that were previously thought to be beyond the capability of machines.\\n\\nI should extract the parts of the context that directly describe what DeepMind is. The first paragraph seems to be the most relevant because it introduces DeepMind and mentions their notable AI systems. The rest of the context is more about the conversation with Demis Hassabis and doesn't add much to defining what DeepMind is.\\n\\nTherefore, the extracted part should include the first paragraph where DeepMind is introduced along with their key achievements.\\n</think>\\n\\nExtracted relevant parts:  \\nthe following is a conversation with demus hasabis ceo and co-founder of deepmind a company that has published and builds some of the most incredible artificial intelligence systems in the history of computing including alfred zero that learned all by itself to play the game of gold better than any human in the world and alpha fold two that solved protein folding both tasks considered nearly impossible for a very long time\"),\n",

Then it specifically points out that DeepMind can be thought of as interdisciplinary, combining neuroscience ideas and AI engineering ideas. \\n\\nSo, from this, I understand that DeepMind is a company or entity that works at the intersection of neuroscience and AI. It brings together concepts from both fields.

The sentence is: \"one can even think of deep mind as i said earlier as a sort of interdisciplinary between neuroscience ideas and ai engineering ideas uh originally and so um so i think there\\'s that...\" \\n\\nThis sentence clearly explains what DeepMind is in the context provided. It connects DeepMind with being interdisciplinary, linking neuroscience and AI engineering. \\n\\nI don\\'t see any other parts of the context that directly explain what DeepMind is.

       "{'context': '<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the topic of aliens is discussed in the given video context and, if so, what was discussed. Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\\n\\nThe context provided is a transcript of someone speaking. They mention \"interactions with our mind\" that might not originate from us but from \"other life forms elsewhere.\" That immediately makes me think of aliens or extraterrestrial life. So, yes, aliens are being discussed here.\\n\\nNext, the speaker talks about consciousness and how it might be something that could be used by alien species. They question why all alien species would use this method, suggesting that some might be more primitive, similar to our level, while others could be more advanced. They mention a \"normal distribution\" of these life forms, implying a variety in their characteristics.\\n\\nThe speaker also speculates about the behavior of these alien civilizations. They say some could be aggressive, others curious, and some philosophical, especially if they\\'re millions of years older than us. They argue against the idea that all alien civilizations would be uniform in their behavior or communication methods. The example given is that some could be \"violent dictatorships,\" which suggests that the speaker is discussing the potential societal structures of these alien civilizations.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, the video does discuss aliens, focusing on the diversity of their possible behaviors, communication methods, and societal structures. The speaker is presenting a hypothesis that alien life forms could vary widely, challenging the notion that they would all interact with humans in the same way.\\n\\nI need to extract the relevant parts of the context as they are, without editing. The key sections are where they talk about other life forms influencing our minds, the normal distribution of alien species, their possible behaviors, and the example of a violent dictatorship. These parts directly address the question about aliens and what was discussed regarding them.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe video discusses the topic of aliens, focusing on their potential diversity in behavior and societal structures.

Let me read through the context carefully. \\n\\nThe context starts with a conversation between the host and Demis Hassabis, the CEO and co-founder of DeepMind. It talks about DeepMind\\'s achievements like AlphaZero and AlphaFold 2, which are AI systems. The host mentions that these systems were able to solve complex tasks that were previously thought impossible, like playing Go better than any human and solving protein folding. \\n\\nThen the conversation starts with a personal question to Demis, asking if the host is an AI program written by Demis to interview people until he gets good enough. \\n\\nI don\\'t see any mention of aliens in the context provided. The discussion is entirely about AI, DeepMind\\'s projects, and the host\\'s introduction. There\\'s no reference to extraterrestrial life or any related topics. \\n\\nSo, since there\\'s no part of the context that talks about aliens, the answer should be that there\\'s no relevant information, hence NO_OUTPUT.\\n</think>\\n\\nNO_OUTPUT\\n\\n<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the topic of aliens is discussed in the given context. Let me read through the context carefully. \\n\\nThe context starts with \"energy and climate so we talked about disease and biology...\" It seems like the main topics are energy, climate, disease, and biology. The speaker mentions AI helping with these areas, specifically fusion as part of energy. They talk about collaborating with a Swiss institute and using their test reactor. \\n\\nI don\\'t see any mention of aliens or anything related to extraterrestrial life. The discussion is focused on scientific areas like fusion, material science, and engineering. There\\'s no shift in topic towards UFOs, alien life, or space in general beyond what\\'s related to energy and climate solutions.\\n\\nSo, since the context doesn\\'t touch on aliens at all, the answer should be that the topic isn\\'t discussed. Therefore, I shouldn\\'t extract any parts of the context because none of it is relevant to the question about aliens.\\n</think>\\n\\nNO_OUTPUT\\n\\n<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the topic of aliens is discussed in the given context. Let me read through the context carefully. \\n\\nThe context starts with a discussion about tools we build and how they might not help us understand everything. It mentions non-human systems possibly reaching farther, not just as tools but in themselves understanding something they can bring back. Then it goes into a conversation about what humans can understand today versus the totality of what\\'s there to be understood. It talks about three consensus points, exploring more branches of a tree, and how AI will help explore that. It ends with a question about the totality of what could be understood and mentions fundamental physics reasons why certain things can\\'t be understood, like what\\'s outside the universe.\\n\\nHmm, I don\\'t see any mention of aliens here. The conversation is more about human understanding, AI, and the limits of physics. So, the topic of aliens isn\\'t discussed in this context. \\n\\nI should make sure I didn\\'t miss anything. Let me scan again. No, it\\'s all about understanding, AI, and physics. No aliens mentioned. So the answer is that the topic isn\\'t discussed.\\n</think>\\n\\nNO_OUTPUT',\n",
